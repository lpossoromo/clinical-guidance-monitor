    "content": "Hundreds of thousands more women attended NHS breast screening last year and thousands more cancers were diagnosed early in England. \n\nNew figures today show that in 2024/25, 1.94 million women aged 50 to 70 attended screening within six months of invitation – up nearly 200,000 (193,745) from 1.75 million the previous year.\n\nAs a result, nearly 20,000 cancers (19,291) were detected – 9 cases in every 1,000 women screened – which is up almost 16% on the previous year, when 16,677 cancers were diagnosed through NHS breast screening.\n\nThis means thousands more women were able to access treatment earlier, when there are more options available and treatment is more likely to be effective.\n\nEncouragingly, attendance among women invited for screening for the first time reached 63.6% – the highest level in a decade – with 4.79 million eligible women now up to date with their breast screening – also a ten-year high.\n\nOverall, around 71.8% of eligible women are now up to date with screening under the programme’s three-year standard, up 1.8 percentage points on last year.\n\nDespite this progress, the latest statistics from the NHS Breast Screening Programme show that around three in ten women did not take up the offer of screening.\n\nLocal screening services are working with NHS England to improve uptake, including targeted outreach in lower-attending areas, reminder texts and expanded use of mobile screening units to bring services closer to home.\n\nThe NHS also launched its first-ever national breast screening campaign in February last year to support even more women to come forward.\n\nBacked by charities including Breast Cancer Now, the campaign featured public figures including Victoria Derbyshire, Julia Bradbury and Shirley Ballas who all shared personal messages to encourage women to attend.\n\nDuring the campaign period, the NHS saw a huge increase in people accessing information online, with tens of thousands of women visiting NHS breast screening pages in a single week and clicks to the screening service finder rising sharply.\n\nDr Harrison Carter, Director of Screening at NHS England, said : “Breast screening can save lives. With nearly 20,000 cancers detected early through screening last year, it’s encouraging to see more women attending, especially those invited for the first time, because making screening a habit can help protect your health for years to come.”\n\n“But we know there are a range of reasons why some women don’t come forward and there is much more still to do to support more women to access breast screening. If you receive an invitation, please don’t ignore it. It’s an appointment that could save your life.”\n\nPhilomena, whose breast cancer was detected through routine screening, said she nearly ignored her invitation before deciding to attend: “Encouraging women to attend their breast screening appointment is something that I am extremely passionate about, as I know how much it matters. I’ve lost friends who might still be here if their cancer had been found earlier, and I very nearly ignored my own screening invitation, too. At the time, I didn’t want to disrupt a new job I loved, but that small delay could have cost me everything.\n\nWhen I finally went for my mammogram, it led to the early detection of stage 2 breast cancer. Hearing those words was devastating, but catching it early meant I had a fighting chance. Treatment was challenging, but it gave me my life back, and it strengthened my commitment to raising awareness about the importance of breast screening in my community.\n\nScreening is quick, free, and could be the difference between catching cancer early or too late. Please make the time for your appointment. Prioritising your health isn’t selfish it’s essential. My screening saved my life, and it could save yours too.”\n\nWomen aged 50 up to the age of 71 are invited for breast screening every three years, with appointments provided locally through clinics and mobile units.\n\nBreast screening does have some risks. Some women who have screening will be diagnosed and treated for slow-growing breast cancers that may never otherwise have been found or caused them harm. Mammograms also do not always find a cancer that is there, but most people feel the benefits of breast screening outweigh the possible risks.\n\nRead more about NHS plans for breast screening .\n\nAdditional information\n\n3-year screening coverage (women screened within 36 months): 71.8%, up 1.8 percentage points on 2023/24\n\noverall uptake (aged 50–70): 70.6%, up from 70.0% last year\n\ninvitations issued: 2.75 million (around 10% increase)\n\nwomen screened (routine programme): 1.94 million women aged 50–70 attended screening within six months of invitation, up from 1.75 million the previous year\n\noverall screening activity: 2.15 million women aged 45+ were screened in 2024/25, a 10.3% increase on 2023/24\n\ncancers detected through screening: 19,291 (rate of 9.0 per 1,000 screened)\n\nfirst-invite uptake: 63.6%, the highest level in 10 years\n\nfollowing the national campaign launch, NHS breast screening advice pages recorded more than 32,000 visits in one week, a 145% increase\n\nall figures relate to the 2024/25 NHS Breast Screening Programme annual statistics \n\nDate published : 19 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 19 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer \nPatient care",

Despite this, teams continued to handover patients on average more quickly than last year (32:03 vs 32:23).\n\nNHS national medical director, Dr Claire Fuller, said : “It’s vital that we do all we can to avoid a second surge in norovirus at a time when the NHS remains flat out coping with winter pressures.\n\n“The public has a huge role to play in stopping the spread of this bug by taking some simple precautions like good hand hygiene with regular handwashing with soap and water.\n\n“If you have symptoms, stay home, rest and drink fluids, and please don’t go to places like, schools, workplaces, hospitals and care homes until you have been symptom free for at least two days.\n\n“If you have any concerns about norovirus symptoms, local pharmacies can provide support and advice and remedies, or please contact 111 or use 111 Online.”\n\nDate published : 19 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 19 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nWinter news and guidance",

    "content": "Millions of adults facing debilitating anxiety conditions are missing out on treatment that could help them recover and get back on with their lives the NHS has said, as it launches a major new mental health campaign. \n\nNew analysis of NHS data shows that over 670,000 people were treated with NHS talking therapy care last year – nearly 70,000 more than pre-pandemic (12% increase on 2019) – with a record 83,000 accessing employment support through the service in 2025 to help them return to work (20% increase on 2024).\n\nYet around one in five adults in England (an estimated 9.4 million) are now affected by a common mental health condition – with the NHS’ top mental health doctor warning that millions are still missing out on available support.\n\nIn response, the NHS has launched a landmark new campaign urging those facing 6 common anxiety conditions that treatment is available for to come forward for support by self-referring online at nhs.uk/talk .\n\nWhile conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have a huge impact on people’s daily lives, a new NHS survey of over 2,000 adults found that nearly 3 in 5 (58%) delay seeking treatment and support as they feel the conditions are “not serious enough” – with 1 in 5 (21%) not seeking help at all.\n\nNHS England’s campaign is backed by Eastenders actress Shona McGarty, TOWIE’s Charlie King, and former professional footballer and Professional Footballers’ Association chair, Clarke Carlisle – who are candidly sharing their own experiences to encourage others to come forward.\n\nNHS talking therapies provide people with practical skills and techniques to overcome a range of mental health conditions like OCD, social anxiety disorder, PTSD, panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and phobias. Anyone can self-refer online without needing to see their GP or have an already diagnosed mental health condition.\n\nDr Adrian James, NHS England’s National Medical Director for Mental Health and Neurodiversity said: “While it’s encouraging that thousands more people facing mental health conditions are accessing NHS support than before the pandemic, we know that millions more could benefit from vital NHS talking therapies.\n\n“This landmark new campaign is a critical step to ensuring that everyone struggling with challenging but very common conditions like anxiety and PTSD knows that there is support available to help them get on with their lives again.\n\n“Through proven treatment and support available for free on the NHS, these conditions can be overcome to help people return to work, regain confidence or feel back to their old selves in social situations.\n\n“Our message is clear, if you’re struggling with your mental health, NHS talking therapies are here for you, and you can either self-refer or speak with your local GP practice”.\n\nJo, 40, a data engineer based in Solihull in the West Midlands, has been treated by NHS talking therapies after living undiagnosed with PTSD for years.\n\nAt just 22, Jo received a devastating cancer diagnosis and was given months to live, unless a matching stem cell donor could be found. She began to prepare emotionally for her death – but, against the odds, a donor was found, and she underwent a life-saving transplant. Jo spent her 30s rebuilding herself and moving forward in her life, but her resilience was tested again when her son was born with a rare genetic condition that requires frequent hospital visits and procedures. Constant worry and trying to be “too strong, for too long” eroded her mental health and wiped her out physically.\n\nDuring one of her son’s appointments, the health visitor noticed that she was particularly stressed and encouraged her to look into NHS talking therapies. A year later Jo reached a breaking point and made the decision to seek help. Initially assuming she had general anxiety, Jo discovered through therapy that she had been living with undiagnosed PTSD for years.\n\nShe began eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy – which has completely changed how she approaches life now. Guided by a skilled NHS therapist, she learned to process her unresolved traumatic memories, develop coping mechanisms, and finally understand her reactions. During her therapy, her son underwent a procedure under general anaesthetic, and for the first time, Jo felt calm and able to support him without spiralling. It was the moment she realised: “this is working”.\n\nJo finished therapy a year ago, and the effects have been transformative. Her sleep has improved dramatically; she no longer wakes exhausted from trauma‑filled dreams and feels more present in her life. She is an avid cyclist and has achieved gold medals in Time Trial and Team Triathlon for Team GB at the World Transplant Games.\n\nJo said: “Following various health battles that affected me and my son, I tried for a long time to stay strong. I thought I was just anxious, but I was carrying years of unresolved trauma that I had never processed. I never thought that PTSD could happen to me, but it can affect anyone, as life is so unpredictable.\n\n“Therapy has been unbelievable and completely changed my life. I sleep better, worry less, and I finally feel present in my life again. If you feel like you need help, you do. Put your hand up and self-refer to NHS talking therapies as early as you can. I wish I had done it sooner. Time is so precious”.\n\nAnthony, 37, is a Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Manager from Carlisle, who has lived with panic disorder since he was 16.\n\nFor 20 years he carried shame, fear and confusion about his symptoms, which he says often mimicked those of a heart attack. He tried to manage it alone, worried that opening up would make him seem weak, and only shared his struggles in his early twenties.\n\nAfter the loss of his grandmother in 2024 and a particularly stressful period at work, Anthony began experiencing up to 6 panic attacks a day. Supported by his wife and colleagues, he was referred to NHS talking therapies, something he initially resisted as he wasn’t keen on speaking to a stranger. But over 10-12 sessions, he slowly realised how much relief came from putting his experiences into words. Using tools such as keeping a diary and setting clear goals, he began to understand and manage the physical sensations that once overwhelmed him.\n\nAnthony said: I lived with panic attacks for 20 years, trying to manage it alone, and it impacted every part of my life. The constant worry about when the next panic attack would happen made it really difficult to focus – at work, I couldn’t get through emails or daily tasks, and in my personal life I couldn’t concentrate long enough to read books which was always something that had brought me comfort.\n\n“But NHS talking therapies changed everything – its broken a cycle I thought Id be stuck in forever. I went from having 6 panic attacks a day at its worst, to just 1 or 2 a month now – I finally feel in control again and am able to concentrate for longer periods, so have even started reading again and joined a book club. If you’re struggling, please don’t wait as long as I did. You only get one life, so be brave enough to put yourself first and get the support you deserve.\n\nIn a new survey of 2,002 adults in England, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of the NHS, nearly half of the public said they did not know anything about social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, while two thirds did not know what body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is.\n\nThe survey found that strong misconceptions around conditions persist – with over a third of the public thinking ‘most people are a bit OCD’ and nearly 3 in 10 believe PTSD mainly affects military veterans and 1 in 5 think social anxiety is ‘the same as being shy’.\n\nThe latest NHS talking therapies statistics show that the vast majority of patients referred to the service access treatment within 6 weeks, with 88.6% accessing services within 6 weeks of their referral last year.\n\nAlso speaking out about the benefits of NHS talking therapies as part of the campaign is Phillip Davis, 41 from Cheshire.\n\nPhillip said: “I struggled with my mental health a lot in the past. But when I was on my own after my divorce, I realised that if I didn’t do something to help myself, I was going to lose my kids. I was probably going to end up in hospital, because I had tried to overdose once at that point. I thought, I can’t survive like this – I knew I needed help, and I didn’t know what to do on my own.\n\n“Every session I’ve had with NHS talking therapies, I’ve walked out feeling at least a little bit better. They don’t tell you what to do, but they help you find ways to deal with things. Sometimes it’s cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sometimes it’s just a change in outlook — like looking at something from a different angle. It helps massively.\n\n“And after my last round of talking therapies, when I was also going through employment support, they helped build my self-confidence, and I made some big life choices not long after.\n\nHis message to others is: “Get the help that’s there. I know it can be hard to find, especially for blokes. But it is there, and you should take it”.\n\nThe NHS campaign will run for 6 weeks ​with adverts showing across TV-on-demand services, online video, radio, digital audio and podcasts, social media and search engines.\n\nNHS talking therapies treatment involves talking to a trained professional in a safe space about your thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and can include methods such as CBT, counselling or guided self-help, depending on the mental health condition.\n\nLatest official statistics , published by NHS England, show that people of working age (16 to 64) are more likely to have a common mental health condition than those aged 75 and over. Prevalence among those aged 16 to 64 was nearly 1 in 4 (22.6%), compared to around 1 in 10 of those aged 75 and over (10.2%).\n\nThe new campaign puts a spotlight on 6 common mental health conditions, which are often mistaken or underplayed, and can be treated by NHS talking therapies.\n\nCommon symptoms for these conditions include:\n\nfrequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours (OCD)\n\nlong-term and overwhelming fear of social situations (social anxiety disorder)\n\ninvoluntarily and vividly reliving traumatic events in the form of flashbacks or nightmares (PTSD)\n\nhaving regular and sudden panic attacks, often for no apparent reason (panic disorder)\n\nhaving an overwhelming and debilitating fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal (phobia)\n\nobsessive thoughts and worry about your appearance (body dysmorphic disorder)\n\nFormer Eastenders actress, Shona McGarty, said: “I was always a chatty child, but as I got older, everything changed. Around 15, I suddenly became painfully self-aware. I started overthinking, struggling to hold conversations, even though talking was literally part of my job.\n\n“My social anxiety would happen when meeting new people, with colleagues or even at family gatherings. My heart would race, my hands would sweat, and sometimes I thought I might faint. I sometimes pretend to receive a phone call just to leave a social situation. People would say, “Shona’s so shy,” or “she’s so quiet,” and it really hurt.\n\n“I’m worlds away from that level of panic now, because I’ve learned how to deal with it when it shows up. One thing that helps is imagining a little devil on my shoulder. I acknowledge it, and then I answer back: Thank you, but you’re wrong. I’m in control. I’m safe. People aren’t judging me; they’re listening because they want to hear me speak.\n\n“But the biggest help of all has been talking about it. Acknowledging social anxiety instead of fighting it. You’d be amazed at how many people feel the same way. A problem shared really is a problem halved”.\n\nFormer professional footballer and mental health campaigner, Clarke Carlisle said: “For over a decade, my PTSD caused me to withdraw not just from the world, but more importantly, from my family. My symptoms would be at their worst over Christmas Id experience flashbacks, traumatic memories and racing thoughts, and feared the lead up to December for many years.\n\nNow, looking at the photo of myself and family celebrating my daughter’s 18th birthday during the festive period means the world to me. This was the first winter where I didnt experience symptoms of PTSD but its also a moment that simply wouldn’t exist if I hadn’t received treatment for my mental health, allowing me to talk through feelings and getting me to a place where I can spend precious moments with my family again.\n\nTOWIE’s Charlie King said: “The London Landmarks Half Marathon was a real turning point for me. After months of feeling incredibly low and demotivated because of crippling body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), signing up felt overwhelming, and I genuinely didn’t know if I’d see it through. When my BDD was at its worst, I had become reclusive, Id hide behind a cap, and sometimes even looking at myself in the mirror when brushing my teeth would send me into a spiral. But through therapy, I’ve come to understand it, understand my thought-patterns and tools to manage it.\n\nCrossing that finish line was the first time in a long time that I felt proud of myself.  Similar to my recovery journey, 13 miles once felt impossible, but taking it step by step showed me that I could keep pushing forward.\n\n“So, I look at this photo, and I can truly appreciate myself. None of this would have been possible without therapy, and I am really proud of taking the first step.\n\nMedia medic, Dr Nighat Arif GP said: “The new NHS poll reveals a worrying ‘blind spot’ in public awareness around many common mental health conditions linked to anxiety. This could mean that people are missing out on treatment because they don’t recognise symptoms, are embarrassed by them, or think they are not serious enough to get help for. If your life, work or relationships are being affected by OCD, phobias, body dysmorphic disorder, social anxiety or PTSD, remember that support is available with NHS talking therapies. It’s free, and your GP can refer you, or you can refer yourself online. You’ll speak to a trained therapist about your thoughts and feelings and learn practical skills and techniques so you can overcome your condition and help get you back to living your life”.\n\nYou can find out more and refer yourself for NHS Talking Therapies at nhs.uk/talk .\n\nDate published : 18 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 19 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nMental health",

    "content": "Thousands of people living with schizophrenia and severe depression are being recruited by the NHS for a major new study which could unlock a “new era” of personalised treatment for severe mental illness. \n\nAs part of the world’s largest mental health study, researchers will analyse the DNA of thousands of people alongside detailed questionnaires to discover what can increase the risk and severity of serious mental health conditions.\n\nFrom this week, almost 50,000 eligible adults living with bipolar, schizophrenia, psychosis or major depression in England and Wales are being invited to join the study, known as GlobalMinds.\n\nNHS England’s DigiTrials service will identify eligible patients and contact them to see if they would like to take part to help find new treatments.\n\nPatients will be provided with at-home sampling kits as well as with targeted support from the NHS for those who are more severely ill or face barriers to using technology.\n\nThe study will combine genetic data from blood or saliva samples given by volunteers with online questionnaire responses and information from their NHS medical records – linking genes, background, biology and mental health.\n\nThe initiative will develop most detailed ever dataset on serious mental health condition to help transform understanding, improve diagnosis and unlock new, more personalised treatments.\n\nThe three-year study, led by mental health data science company Akrivia Health Ltd in partnership with Cardiff University, has been launched in England and Wales initially and later will expand internationally.\n\nDr Adrian James, NHS England’s National Medical Director for Mental Health and Neurodiversity, said : “This major new study could transform our understanding of severe mental illness and lead to the dawn of a new era of personalised treatments for patients with conditions including schizophrenia and severe depression.\n\n“People living with a severe mental illness are affected by their condition every day – and it can often lead to preventable physical conditions and shorter lifespans.\n\n“The new study gives us the opportunity to change the way we treat these conditions and we’re using the NHS’s DigiTrials service is to invite suitable people faster, fairly and at scale. I’d encourage anyone contacted to consider signing up to be part of this ground-breaking study.”\n\nTen NHS mental health trusts are already supporting the project and anyone over 18 from those areas who has been diagnosed with a severe mental health condition can join.\n\nA total of 49,000 people with mental illnesses are being sought, with 2,000 already enrolled and NHS DigiTrials inviting further eligible patients. Another 1,000 people with dementia will also be included in the study.\n\nGlobalMinds’ Chief Investigator, Professor James Walters from Cardiff University, said : “GlobalMinds provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover and identify the many personal and biological factors behind mental health conditions, so researchers can help clinicians and patients by enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis, and making available optimum treatments for all patients.\n\n“Precision medicine has already revolutionised the treatment of cancer and other rare diseases and we want GlobalMinds to bring the same breakthroughs to mental health. By creating the first large-scale dataset linking both genetic and detailed routine clinical information, GlobalMinds will unlock a new era of personalised mental health care, so we can help tackle the global mental health crisis.”\n\nThe charity Rethink Mental Illness is also supporting the study and will help raise awareness of the research among people severely affected by mental illness.\n\nBrian Dow, Deputy Chief Executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: “This study has real potential to deepen our understanding and open the door to a new generation of treatments for mental illness.\n\n“The strength of the study lies in the partnership between researchers, the NHS and charities like ours, which means data can be powerfully fused with lived experience, with the voices of people experiencing mental illness remaining front and centre.\n\n“We’re delighted to be supporting the study to reach as many people living with severe mental illness as possible.\n\nGlobalMinds has also been designed to ensure the experience of people taking part is prioritised, with a dedicated Patient Public Involvement and Engagement group.\n\nAkeela Mohammed, a GlobalMinds’ Patient Public Involvement and Engagement Adviser and Founder of Healthy Her, a not-for-profit organisation that empowers South Asian women through wellbeing, sport, and community engagement, said :\n\n“It is vital that research initiatives like GlobalMinds are created from beginning to end with the voices and needs of vulnerable and less included communities at their heart, so that the outcomes benefit as many people as possible.\n\n“That’s why I’ve enjoyed providing both my personal experience of mental health and professional insights into the barriers diverse communities face in accessing research, to this groundbreaking study and I cannot wait to see how this people-powered research will transform lives.”\n\nThe study is supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), with funding from the Wellcome Trust and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nAnyone aged over 18, who is living with a diagnosed severe mental health condition and lives in participating areas, can sign up at: globalminds.org \n\nFor the GlobalMinds study, eligible patients are being invited to participate and no ones data is shared with researchers without their knowledge and permission.\n\nFurther information\n\nMore information about Global Minds is available here: globalminds.org \n\nGlobalMinds is open to anyone aged 18 or over with a diagnosis of Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Major Depression, or a related condition who live in an area with a participating NHS Trust. Participants sign up online via: globalminds.org and following a brief eligibility check, answer a digital questionnaire. They then are asked to provide either a blood or saliva sample. At-home testing kits or visits are available, and all participants will receive a voucher of up to £50 as a thank you for taking part.

    "content": "The NHS delivered more elective activity in 2025 than any other year in its history, helping cut the waiting list to its lowest level since February 2023. \n\nStaff delivered a historic high of 18.4 million treatments and operations in 2025, up from 18 million in 2024, as the waiting list dropped to 7.29 million.\n\nToday’s data shows there were 1.43 million treatments delivered in December – an increase of 91,775 on last year – despite 5 days of industrial action by resident doctors, thanks to staff maintaining almost 95% of usual activity during strikes.\n\nThe percentage of people waiting over 18 weeks for treatment slightly decreased to 61.5%, while the percentage of those waiting over 52 weeks dropped to just 1.9% – the lowest since June 2020 – as the Elective Reform Plan continues to drive NHS services to tackle the longest waits and ensure more people are seen quicker.\n\nThe progress comes thanks to the Elective Reform Plan, which has led to an expansion of community diagnostic centres and surgical hubs, creating more evening and weekend clinics, as well as sending patients straight to test rather than multiple clinic visits.\n\nWhile NHS staff used innovative measures across the country including high-intensity theatre (HIT) lists across elective surgery hubs to maximise the number of patients treated in one day or using robotic-assisted surgeries to speed up procedures and increase precision – getting more patients home sooner and recovering faster.\n\nThe data also shows demand across emergency services is showing no signs of letting up, with the NHS on track for its busiest winter ever.\n\nA&E staff experienced a record high January of 2,320,266 A&E attendances – 4.6% higher than in January 2025 – while ambulance staff have faced a record number of incidents across December and January.\n\nDespite this, staff continue to manage the ever-increasing demand, with 206,800 more people admitted, transferred or discharged in less than 4 hours in Type 1 A&E departments across winter so far this year when compared to last year (3.4 million in October 2025 to January 2026 vs 3.2 million in October 2024 to January 2025).\n\n4-hour NHS performance has been at 73.5% across winter so far – up from 72.1% last year and less than 70% the year before.\n\nAmbulance response times are quicker than last winter, with both Category 1 and Category 2 response times down on last year (C1 8:08 and C2 35:04 in January 2026 vs C1 8:16 and C2 35:39 in January 2025).\n\nSeparate figures also published today show hospitals are continuing to face the impact of seasonal viruses, with an average of 1,119 patients in hospital with flu and 929 with norovirus each day last week.\n\nThe government launched the National Cancer Plan last week, committing the NHS to meet all cancer waiting time standards by 2029, with hundreds of thousands more patients treated within 62 days.\n\nStaff carried out 2.37 million tests and checks in December alongside 77.4% of people receiving the all-clear or a cancer diagnosis within 4 weeks of an urgent suspected cancer referral – the highest proportion in 9 months (76.7% in April 2025).\n\nDuncan Burton, Chief Nursing Officer for England, said: “Completing a historic high of elective activity is a triumph for NHS staff who continue to innovate and go above and beyond to treat more patients, faster.\n\n“Thanks to early preparations and careful planning, ambulance waits are shorter and A&E treatment times are faster this winter – even as staff face record demand – while we know there is further to go in improving patient flow and cutting the longest emergency department waits.”\n\n“We saw a great response from the public with many people getting protected against winter viruses this year, which is paying off for patients and keeping more people well and at home.\n\n“With a particularly wet start to the year and cold weather alerts issued for England over the weekend, as ever, it’s really important the public continue to come forward for care in the usual way – by dialling 999 in an emergency and otherwise using 111 online, your local pharmacist or GP”.\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting said: “Despite having to deal with flu and industrial action, the NHS has managed to continue cutting waiting lists, thanks to a Herculean effort this winter.\n\n“This government has cut waiting lists by more than 330,000, with hundreds of thousands more people treated within 18 weeks. That’s not happening by chance – it’s because we delivered record levels of care in 2025.\n\n“This progress is driven by unprecedented investment and modernisation of our health service, and above all by the dedication of NHS staff.\n\n“Whether it’s by opening up new community diagnostic centres, rolling out surgical hubs to tackle backlogs, or investing in modern equipment and technology, we are rebuilding our NHS.\n\n“There’s so much more to do, but people can take hope and optimism from the fact that the NHS is finally on the road to recovery.”\n\nYellow cold health alerts for England have been issued by the UK Health Security Agency for either side of the weekend – with temperatures expected to drop from tomorrow until the start of next week (Friday 13 to Monday 16 February), as temperatures have fallen in recent days to drop below freezing which could lead to increased pressure on hospitals, especially by vulnerable people.\n\nDate published : 12 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 12 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nElective care \nWinter news and guidance",

Ambulances are handing over faster, delays are coming down and flu is taking up fewer hospital beds than last year, even with demand running at near-record levels. That’s real progress, driven by the dedication of frontline staff and better preparation than ever before.\n\n“We backed that effort with £450 million for urgent and emergency care, 500 new ambulances on the road and millions of vaccinations delivered this winter for flu, Covid and RSV, keeping people protected and out of hospital.\n\n“Winter pressures haven’t gone away, but the NHS is meeting them head on. If you’re eligible, get vaccinated, follow public health advice and help us keep the service there for everyone who needs it.”\n\nAmy Douglas, Lead Epidemiologist at UKHSA, said :Norovirus activity has remained high in recent weeks, particularly among those aged 65 years and over and is now rising in children aged under 5 years too. Outbreaks in hospital settings have increased too, so please remember the simple steps we can all take to stop norovirus spreading.\n\n“Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so don’t rely on these alone.\n\n“If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, don’t return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and don’t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection to those most vulnerable.”\n\nThe weekly situation report publications can be found here:  Statistics » Urgent and Emergency Care Daily Situation Reports 2025-26 \n\nDate published : 29 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 6 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nWinter news and guidance",

    "content": "Patients facing suspected lung cancer could get answers sooner under a new NHS pilot using artificial intelligence and robotic technology to help doctors reach hard-to-detect cancers earlier, with fewer invasive tests.  \n\nThe new approach uses AI software to rapidly analyse lung scans and flag small lumps that are most likely to be cancerous, and a robotic camera is then used to guide biopsy tools through the airways with far greater precision than standard techniques.\n\nThe pilot comes alongside plans for the NHS to expand lung cancer screening, ensuring every eligible person is invited for checks in less than five years, no matter where they live, continuing the Government’s drive to tackle inequalities in cancer outcomes as part of the National Cancer Plan.\n\nLung cancer contributes to a whole year of the nine-year life expectancy gap between richer and poorer parts of England, and the National Cancer Plan will prioritise solving inequalities to ensure patients can get fairer and faster access to cancer care.\n\nThe NHS’s top cancer doctor hailed the project at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust as “a glimpse of the future of cancer detection”, combining cutting-edge AI with robotic technology that can travel deep inside the lungs to reach tiny, hard-to-access nodules.\n\nThe robot can reach nodules as small as 6mm — around the size of a grain of rice — hidden deep in the lung and often too risky or difficult to access using existing methods.\n\nOnce AI has highlighted higher-risk areas, doctors can take a precise tissue sample, which is sent to specialist laboratories and reviewed by expert cancer teams to confirm or rule out cancer.\n\nFor many patients, weeks of repeat scans and procedures could be replaced with a single, half-hour cancer biopsy, reducing prolonged uncertainty and avoiding more invasive surgery.\n\nIf shown to be effective, the technology could help transform lung cancer diagnosis as the NHS screening programme increasingly identifies more people with very small nodules that would previously have gone undetected until much later.\n\nMore than 1.5 million people have attended an NHS lung health check since 2021, helping identify thousands of cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage and increasing the need for safe, precise biopsy techniques like robotic bronchoscopy.\n\nThe expansion is set to see the NHS invite 1.4 million people for a lung cancer check next year alone. The programme is expected to diagnose up to 50,000 cancers by 2035 and at least 23,000 at an earlier stage, potentially saving thousands of lives.\n\nProfessor Peter Johnson, NHS England’s National Clinical Director for Cancer, said : “Waiting to find out if you might have cancer is incredibly stressful for patients and their families.\n\n“Our lung cancer screening programme means that we are picking up more cancers at an early stage than ever, and by bringing AI and robotics together in this trailblazing NHS pilot, we’re bringing in the very latest technology to give clinicians a clearer look inside the lungs and support faster, more accurate biopsies.\n\n“This is a glimpse of the future of cancer detection. Innovation like this is exactly how we can help diagnose more cancers faster, so treatment can be most effective, and why the NHS continues to lead the way in bringing new technology safely into frontline care.”\n\nWes Streeting, Health and Social Care Secretary, said:  “When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer, the NHS saved my life using robotic technology. That experience showed me whats possible when brilliant clinicians have access to cutting-edge innovation – it saves lives.\n\n“Lung cancer is one of the biggest killers in the UK, taking an extra year of people’s lives in the poorest parts of the country. This pilot will help to catch it earlier, replacing weeks of invasive testing with a single targeted procedure. For patients waiting anxiously for answers, this speed and precision can be life-changing.\n\n“This is our National Cancer Plan in action – shifting from late diagnosis to early intervention and from analogue to digital, ensuring every patient can benefit from the blend of human care alongside game changing technology, no matter where they live.”\n\nDr Anne Rigg, Medical Director for Cancer and Surgery at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, said : “This pilot brings together artificial intelligence and robotic technology as genuinely disruptive tools to simplify and shorten the lung cancer diagnostic pathway. By combining AI-enabled risk stratification with highly precise robotic biopsy, we are reducing delays and unnecessary steps to diagnosis.\n\n“Crucially, this work is being co-designed with patients and frontline clinical teams, ensuring that the pathway is not only faster, but safer, more equitable, and centred on the patient experience. By improving access to advanced diagnostics we can help reduce variation in care for all patients, regardless of where they are referred from.\n\n“Together, these changes have the potential to support earlier diagnosis and treatment for more patients, which is fundamental to improving long-term outcomes in lung cancer.”\n\nOne person who has already benefited from an earlier identification of lung cancer via the NHS pilot is David Lindsay, an IT contractor from Streatham, London.  David discovered he had stage 1 lung cancer after being referred to Guy’s Hospital for a suspected deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) in his left leg in September 2025. Imaging tests revealed an incidental finding of a nodule on the lung. David had a robotic bronchoscopy to take a tissue sample which confirmed early-stage lung cancer – a primary adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe. This was followed by robotic, lung-sparing surgery, which is less invasive, to remove the cancer.\n\nDavid said : “The efficient staff scheduled me in for the bronchoscopy in the morning and I went home in the evening. It was quick and painless. I wasn’t worried because all the staff made me feel comfortable and assured.\n\n“They clearly explained the findings and after a comprehensive discussion, it was agreed that removal of the cancer was the best option in this instance. The operation was a success.\n\n“The deep vein thrombosis was a blessing in disguise because if it hadn’t occurred, I wouldn’t have had the scan, and various tests, and they wouldn’t have seen the cancer. Who knows when I would have had another check-up, and the next time, the cancer may have reached stage 4.\n\n“I’m very grateful and appreciate the work that the NHS and wonderful staff do every day.”\n\nThe pilot is being led by Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, following successful testing. The team has already carried out around 300 robotic biopsy procedures, with 215 people going on to receive cancer treatment, while others were spared more complex procedures after benign results.\n\nTechnology Secretary Liz Kendall said :Emerging technologies like robotics and AI will be a game-changer for so many people speeding up access to treatment and delivering improved outcomes for patients which would have been unthinkable even a few short years ago.\n\n“This is what it means to be a world leader in technology leaving no stone unturned to make sure it delivers for every community and that its potential is being harnessed to deliver cutting-edge services which change lives for the better.\n\nFrom January, the pilot formally launches at Guy’s and St Thomas’, with planned expansion to King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, allowing more patients referred with suspected lung cancer to benefit from the new approach.\n\nDr Jesme Fox, Medical Director at the charity Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, said : We welcome the announcement of this pilot project at Guys and St Thomass, using AI and robotic technology to more accurately and more quickly diagnose lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer, for many, remains a devastating disease. These initiatives mean that more people affected by this disease, will be picked up earlier, be diagnosed faster and so have a better outcome from treatment.\n\nWe are delighted that the 2030 timeline for the full roll out of the Lung Cancer Screening Programme in England, has been reaffirmed. Screening for people at high risk of lung cancer, with low dose CT chest scans, works. The Programme has already saved thousands of lives, by picking up lung cancer in the early stage, when curative treatment is possible.\n\nSo, if you receive an invitation to take part in the Lung Cancer Screening Programme, do not ignore it.\n\nIf successful, the pilot will help the NHS generate evidence to develop a national commissioning policy for robotic bronchoscopy, supporting more consistent access to the technology across the NHS in future.\n\nFurther information\n\nthe pilot is funded through the NHS Cancer Programme – Innovation Open Call (SBRI Healthcare) \n\nthis is the first NHS pilot to integrate Optellum’s AI risk stratification with Intuitive’s Ion robotic bronchoscopy in a single end-to-end lung cancer diagnostic pathway\n\nOptellum’s Virtual Nodule Clinic is already used across multiple NHS organisations to support lung nodule assessment\n\nthe Ion robotic bronchoscopy system uses an ultra-thin, shape-sensing tube to navigate deep into the lung and take precise biopsy samples\n\nfull evaluation will assess patient and service outcomes; claims relating to survival, waiting times or cost-effectiveness will follow once the pilot is complete\n\nNHS data shows that since the targeted lung health checks initiative began in 2021, early diagnosis rates for lung cancer have grown more rapidly in the most disadvantaged areas\n\nDate published : 27 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 6 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer \nInnovation",

    "content": "Thousands of cases of bowel cancer will be diagnosed earlier or even prevented in England, as part of major NHS plans to increase the sensitivity of bowel cancer screening to save more lives. \n\nNHS England today announced it is to lower the threshold for a home-screening kit to trigger urgent cancer testing from next month, with the NHS checking thousands more people identified with even smaller traces of blood in their poo. \n\nThe NHS estimates the change could help detect around 600 more bowel cancers early each year in England – around an 11% increase – and find 2,000 more people with high-risk polyps in their bowel, allowing patients to have preventative surgery before any cancers develop. \n\nThe home-testing kit, known as the faecal immunochemical test (FIT), is offered to all people over 50 years old and checks for blood in a small stool sample, which can be a sign of bowel cancer. \n\nBy reducing the level at which traces of blood in a FIT test trigger further investigation – from 120 micrograms of blood per gram of poo down to 80 – the NHS will offer 35% more screening colonoscopies each year to help diagnose or rule out bowel cancer. \n\nThe move comes as the NHS is set to launch new digital alerts that a screening kit is on its way in a bid to boost uptake, as part of a radical new National Cancer Plan to be published by the Government next week to transform cancer care by 2035. \n\nPeter Johnson, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said: “This is a major step forward in bowel cancer detection and will help save hundreds more lives from this devastating disease. \n\n“Testing at a lower threshold will now provide a better early-warning system for bowel cancer, helping us to spot and treat cancers earlier, often picking up problems before symptoms appear. \n\n“Earlier detection can mean less intensive treatment and ensures the best chance of survival, and in many cases people could avoid facing cancer altogether by having dangerous polyps removed before they cause harm. \n\n“I would strongly encourage everyone who is sent a bowel screening test to complete it and return it as soon as possible — it really could make all the difference.” \n\nDr Zubir Ahmed, Health Innovation Minister, said: “After 20 years of frontline NHS experience, I know how vital it is that cancer is caught early to give patients a fighting chance. \n\n“I am delighted we are making bowel cancer screening more accessible and sensitive to catch and prevent thousands more cases earlier than ever before. \n\n“We are also rolling out notifications on the NHS App so you know when a test is coming your way. This is another step in the road on our journey to shift our NHS from analogue to digital. \n\nGenevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said: “This is great news for people living in England. This change marks an important moment for bowel cancer screening in the country. \n\n“Increasing the sensitivity of the test means more cancers will be prevented and found earlier, saving more lives from the UK’s fourth most common cancer.”   \n\nMichelle Mitchell, chief executive at Cancer Research UK, said: This vital step from NHS England to lower the threshold for further tests after bowel screening will save lives. It means more cancers will be detected at an earlier stage, when treatment is more likely to be successful, while also preventing some from developing in the first place. \n\nBowel cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer death in England, so its crucial that progress like this continues. \n\nScreening is for people without symptoms, so if anyone spots something that isnt right for them, they should speak to their GP. It probably wont be cancer, but if it is, finding it early can make a real difference. \n\nBowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK for both men and women, and the fourth overall, but screening can catch it early — often before any symptoms appear. \n\nMost people who complete their test will not need further checks, but for those who do, early action can be life-saving. It is estimated that, currently, around 2 in 100 people who take part in bowel screening will require further testing – this is expected to increase to 3 in 100 following the lowering of the threshold. \n\nFor patients, the test itself does not change and remains simple. FIT tests are done at home by putting a sample of poo in a small tube and returning it by post to the NHS for testing. \n\nOnce fully implemented, testing at the lower threshold is expected to reduce late-stage diagnoses and deaths from bowel cancer by around six per cent – while preventing and detecting more cancers earlier will also save the NHS £32 million each year. \n\nThe roll-out follows a pilot at eight early-adopting services, where closer working between NHS screening and diagnostic teams has helped more people get checked sooner, with over 60 additional cancers and nearly 500 high-risk polyps being found and treated. \n\nIn line with recommendations by the UK National Screening Committee, the NHS will now roll out the lower threshold across the country by March 2028. \n\nIvan, a personal trainer who felt fit and healthy, nearly ignored his bowel screening test. He said: “I felt fit, healthy and busy, and I kept putting my bowel screening test off. Cancer wasn’t something I thought would affect me. When I finally sent the test back, it picked up a problem that led to further checks and my diagnosis. \n\n“I’m convinced that doing the test when I did changed everything — and if I’d left it any longer, it could have been a very different story. If your test is sitting in a drawer, don’t put it off. Send it back.” \n\nAt the same time, the NHS is making bowel screening easier to take part in, with digital alerts being introduced from February through the NHS App to make people aware that a home testing kit is on its way. The alerts will let people know what to expect, making it easier to complete the test promptly. \n\nAnyone that requires letter sent by post, including anyone newly eligible for bowel cancer screening, will continue to receive them. \n\nThe NHS rolled out digital communications for cervical screening last year as part of a new ‘ping and book’ service . So far nearly nine in ten women have received screening invites and reminders digitally, making screening quicker, more convenient and less reliant on paper. \n\nThe new functionality comes as record numbers – nearly 40 million people in England – are now using the NHS App to manage their health quickly and conveniently. \n\nLast year, the NHS also completed the expansion of bowel cancer screening to everyone aged 50 to 74, with over 4 million more people invited since roll out began in 2021. \n\nThe NHS is urging everyone eligible to act promptly when their test or digital invite arrives – completing the test promptly can mean simpler treatment, better recovery, or avoiding cancer altogether. \n\nDate published : 26 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 23 January, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer",

    "content": "Thousands of people at higher risk of developing cancer due to inherited faulty genes will be regularly checked and tracked by the NHS thanks to a first-of-its-kind national genetics programme. \n\nThe world-first genetic register, developed by the NHS, will collect patient information on over 100 genes linked to an increased risk of cancer, with plans for it to help fast-track thousands more people to screening and testing, while speeding up access to personalised therapy and trials.\n\nAhead of the government’s landmark new National Cancer Plan next month, England’s top cancer doctor said the genetic register comes as part of “a new era of early cancer detection” to help thousands more people to access tailored information, testing and risk-reducing interventions.\n\nGenomic testing is offered by the NHS for people with cancer and those with a family history of cancer, with tens of thousands accessing it each year.\n\nThose identified by the NHS as having an inherited risk of cancer will be added to the single central register, and for people with changes in certain genes such as BRCA, they will be automatically invited to screening and offered routine tests for certain cancers, including breast cancer.\n\nThis could soon help identify thousands of men between the ages of 45-61 with known BRCA gene mutations who are at high risk of prostate cancer, and who could benefit if the UK National Screening Committee make a final recommendation on screening for prostate cancer in men with a BRCA variant, and that recommendation is accepted by the Secretary of State.\n\nAround 120 cancer susceptibility genes will be covered by the national genomics registry and will include patients diagnosed with cancer who have been found to have inherited faulty genes, as well as patients found to have susceptible genes variants but do not have cancer.\n\nPatients tested via the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and clinical genetic services will be informed of their diagnosis and provided with information around the associated cancer risks and tailored information about what they can do to lower their chance of developing cancer or detect it early, prior to being added to the registry.\n\nProfessor Peter Johnson, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said: “We are entering a new era of early cancer detection with pioneering research and testing helping us to discover more about how genes influence our chances of developing cancer – and this register could help ensure thousands more people can be offered screening, tests and the latest treatments.\n\n“Finding out you have an inherited risk of cancer can be life-changing, but it also supports people to access tailored advice on risk-reducing steps and vital monitoring, to increase the chances of any cancers being picked up early or even preventing the disease altogether.\n\n“As we look to the future of cancer care with our upcoming National Cancer Plan, we know we must continue to find ways to prevent cancers from reaching late stage and this programme will be an important part of helping us save more lives.”\n\nThe creation of this multi-gene database – the NHS National Inherited Cancer Predisposition Register – follows on from the successful Lynch syndrome register, which has ensured thousands of people diagnosed with Lynch syndrome are identified and offered routine preventative screening.\n\nLynch syndrome is a condition which increases the chance of developing certain cancers including bowel, endometrial and ovarian.\n\nOut of every 100 people with Lynch syndrome, screening prevents between 40 and 60 from developing bowel cancer. More than 12,000 people have already received additional bowel screening after being identified as at higher risk through the Lynch syndrome register.\n\nColonoscopy screening can detect and remove precancerous polyps or catch cancer at an early stage when it is treatable and curable.\n\nExpanding the use of genomic testing to identify people at risk of certain cancers and enabling more cancers to be caught earlier will be a major part of the upcoming National Cancer Plan to modernise cancer care for future generations.\n\nSecretary of State for Health and Social Care Wes Streeting said: “1 in every 2 people will get cancer in their lifetime but that does not mean the chances are random – many people face a higher risk through the genes they inherit.\n\n“And while we cannot do anything about inherited genes we can do something about what we do with that information.\n\n“Alongside record levels of investment I am determined to modernise our NHS so it is fit for the 21st century. By launching this world-leading genetic register for people with genetic conditions with an increased risk of cancer, we can provide personalised and preventative care sooner.\n\n“This register wont just supercharge innovation – it will be life changing and life-saving, allowing the NHS to develop individual care, fast-track screening and tailored information to enable more cancers to be caught earlier.\n\nProfessor Dame Sue Hill, Chief Scientific Officer for England and Senior Responsible Officer for Genomics in the NHS, said: “Genomics is becoming an integral part of how we diagnose and treat cancer across the NHS.\n\n“Through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, genetic testing is already offered where it provides clear clinical benefit, and the 10 Year Health Plan sets out a clear ambition to embed genomics more routinely across care pathways. The National Cancer Plan will build on that work, strengthening how genomic testing is used across cancer treatment and individual patient journeys.\n\n“By bringing inherited cancer risk information together in a single national programme, we can support more systematic follow-up, improve the targeting of screening and surveillance, and ensure genomic insights are used more effectively to support earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.”\n\nCharlie Grinstead, 32, from London, a civil engineer, was able to access personalised treatment sooner thanks to genetic testing via the NHS Lynch syndrome register.\n\nCharlie was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2020, aged 26. He underwent surgery to remove the tumour followed by chemotherapy and other targeted treatments. After genetic testing, he was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome and started targeted immunotherapy treatment.\n\nHe said: “I tried 3 different chemotherapy drugs and none of them seemed to be working – it was a rollercoaster of side effects and the drugs not really doing anything, but my Lynch Syndrome diagnosis unlocked the door to have immunotherapy treatment – and proved to be the key to my recovery. It was incredibly effective, almost from day 1, and the side-effects were non-existent compared to the chemotherapy, I thought I was taking a placebo because the side effects just weren’t there.\n\n“It was an absolute game-changer and stopped the cancer from spreading. I now no longer need treatment, and it’s been a huge relief to finish treatment – there is a risk the cancer could return but I have regular scans to monitor it. I’m now able to make plans for the future – enjoying precious time with my wife and son, and am just incredibly grateful to spend time with family and friends.”\n\nThe NHS National Inherited Cancer Predisposition Register is managed by NHS England’s National Disease Registration Service.\n\nThe NHS Genomics Population Health Service as outlined in the NHS 10 Year Health Plan will support the expansion of genomic testing for high-risk groups over the next 10 years.\n\nFor background\n\nFrom July 2023 to November 2025, 12,245 people with Lynch syndrome have received additional bowel screening.\n\nDate published : 24 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 23 January, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer",
