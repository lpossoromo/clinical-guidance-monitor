                                     "content":  "Hundreds of thousands more women attended NHS breast screening last year and thousands more cancers were diagnosed early in England. \n\nNew figures today show that in 2024/25, 1.94 million women aged 50 to 70 attended screening within six months of invitation â€“ up nearly 200,000 (193,745) from 1.75 million the previous year.\n\nAs a result, nearly 20,000 cancers (19,291) were detected â€“ 9 cases in every 1,000 women screened â€“ which is up almost 16% on the previous year, when 16,677 cancers were diagnosed through NHS breast screening.\n\nThis means thousands more women were able to access treatment earlier, when there are more options available and treatment is more likely to be effective.\n\nEncouragingly, attendance among women invited for screening for the first time reached 63.6% â€“ the highest level in a decade â€“ with 4.79 million eligible women now up to date with their breast screening â€“ also a ten-year high.\n\nOverall, around 71.8% of eligible women are now up to date with screening under the programmeâ€™s three-year standard, up 1.8 percentage points on last year.\n\nDespite this progress, the latest statistics from the NHS Breast Screening Programme show that around three in ten women did not take up the offer of screening.\n\nLocal screening services are working with NHS England to improve uptake, including targeted outreach in lower-attending areas, reminder texts and expanded use of mobile screening units to bring services closer to home.\n\nThe NHS also launched its first-ever national breast screening campaign in February last year to support even more women to come forward.\n\nBacked by charities including Breast Cancer Now, the campaign featured public figures including Victoria Derbyshire, Julia Bradbury and Shirley Ballas who all shared personal messages to encourage women to attend.\n\nDuring the campaign period, the NHS saw a huge increase in people accessing information online, with tens of thousands of women visiting NHS breast screening pages in a single week and clicks to the screening service finder rising sharply.\n\nDr Harrison Carter, Director of Screening at NHS England, said : â€œBreast screening can save lives. With nearly 20,000 cancers detected early through screening last year, itâ€™s encouraging to see more women attending, especially those invited for the first time, because making screening a habit can help protect your health for years to come.â€\n\nâ€œBut we know there are a range of reasons why some women donâ€™t come forward and there is much more still to do to support more women to access breast screening. If you receive an invitation, please donâ€™t ignore it. Itâ€™s an appointment that could save your life.â€\n\nPhilomena, whose breast cancer was detected through routine screening, said she nearly ignored her invitation before deciding to attend: â€œEncouraging women to attend their breast screening appointment is something that I am extremely passionate about, as I know how much it matters. Iâ€™ve lost friends who might still be here if their cancer had been found earlier, and I very nearly ignored my own screening invitation, too. At the time, I didnâ€™t want to disrupt a new job I loved, but that small delay could have cost me everything.\n\nWhen I finally went for my mammogram, it led to the early detection of stage 2 breast cancer. Hearing those words was devastating, but catching it early meant I had a fighting chance. Treatment was challenging, but it gave me my life back, and it strengthened my commitment to raising awareness about the importance of breast screening in my community.\n\nScreening is quick, free, and could be the difference between catching cancer early or too late. Please make the time for your appointment. Prioritising your health isnâ€™t selfish itâ€™s essential. My screening saved my life, and it could save yours too.â€\n\nWomen aged 50 up to the age of 71 are invited for breast screening every three years, with appointments provided locally through clinics and mobile units.\n\nBreast screening does have some risks. Some women who have screening will be diagnosed and treated for slow-growing breast cancers that may never otherwise have been found or caused them harm. Mammograms also do not always find a cancer that is there, but most people feel the benefits of breast screening outweigh the possible risks.\n\nRead more about NHS plans for breast screening .\n\nAdditional information\n\n3-year screening coverage (women screened within 36 months): 71.8%, up 1.8 percentage points on 2023/24\n\noverall uptake (aged 50â€“70): 70.6%, up from 70.0% last year\n\ninvitations issued: 2.75 million (around 10% increase)\n\nwomen screened (routine programme): 1.94 million women aged 50â€“70 attended screening within six months of invitation, up from 1.75 million the previous year\n\noverall screening activity: 2.15 million women aged 45+ were screened in 2024/25, a 10.3% increase on 2023/24\n\ncancers detected through screening: 19,291 (rate of 9.0 per 1,000 screened)\n\nfirst-invite uptake: 63.6%, the highest level in 10 years\n\nfollowing the national campaign launch, NHS breast screening advice pages recorded more than 32,000 visits in one week, a 145% increase\n\nall figures relate to the 2024/25 NHS Breast Screening Programme annual statistics \n\nDate published : 19 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 19 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer \nPatient care",

Anyone can self-refer online without needing to see their GP or have an already diagnosed mental health condition.\n\nDr Adrian James, NHS Englandâ€™s National Medical Director for Mental Health and Neurodiversity said: â€œWhile itâ€™s encouraging that thousands more people facing mental health conditions are accessing NHS support than before the pandemic, we know that millions more could benefit from vital NHS talking therapies.\n\nâ€œThis landmark new campaign is a critical step to ensuring that everyone struggling with challenging but very common conditions like anxiety and PTSD knows that there is support available to help them get on with their lives again.\n\nâ€œThrough proven treatment and support available for free on the NHS, these conditions can be overcome to help people return to work, regain confidence or feel back to their old selves in social situations.\n\nâ€œOur message is clear, if youâ€™re struggling with your mental health, NHS talking therapies are here for you, and you can either self-refer or speak with your local GP practiceâ€.\n\nJo, 40, a data engineer based in Solihull in the West Midlands, has been treated by NHS talking therapies after living undiagnosed with PTSD for years.\n\nAt just 22, Jo received a devastating cancer diagnosis and was given months to live, unless a matching stem cell donor could be found. She began to prepare emotionally for her death â€“ but, against the odds, a donor was found, and she underwent a life-saving transplant. Jo spent her 30s rebuilding herself and moving forward in her life, but her resilience was tested again when her son was born with a rare genetic condition that requires frequent hospital visits and procedures. Constant worry and trying to be â€œtoo strong, for too longâ€ eroded her mental health and wiped her out physically.\n\nDuring one of her sonâ€™s appointments, the health visitor noticed that she was particularly stressed and encouraged her to look into NHS talking therapies. A year later Jo reached a breaking point and made the decision to seek help. Initially assuming she had general anxiety, Jo discovered through therapy that she had been living with undiagnosed PTSD for years.\n\nShe began eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy â€“ which has completely changed how she approaches life now. Guided by a skilled NHS therapist, she learned to process her unresolved traumatic memories, develop coping mechanisms, and finally understand her reactions. During her therapy, her son underwent a procedure under general anaesthetic, and for the first time, Jo felt calm and able to support him without spiralling. It was the moment she realised: â€œthis is workingâ€.\n\nJo finished therapy a year ago, and the effects have been transformative. Her sleep has improved dramatically; she no longer wakes exhausted from traumaâ€‘filled dreams and feels more present in her life. She is an avid cyclist and has achieved gold medals in Time Trial and Team Triathlon for Team GB at the World Transplant Games.\n\nJo said: â€œFollowing various health battles that affected me and my son, I tried for a long time to stay strong. I thought I was just anxious, but I was carrying years of unresolved trauma that I had never processed. I never thought that PTSD could happen to me, but it can affect anyone, as life is so unpredictable.\n\nâ€œTherapy has been unbelievable and completely changed my life. I sleep better, worry less, and I finally feel present in my life again. If you feel like you need help, you do. Put your hand up and self-refer to NHS talking therapies as early as you can. I wish I had done it sooner. Time is so preciousâ€.\n\nAnthony, 37, is a Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Manager from Carlisle, who has lived with panic disorder since he was 16.\n\nFor 20 years he carried shame, fear and confusion about his symptoms, which he says often mimicked those of a heart attack. He tried to manage it alone, worried that opening up would make him seem weak, and only shared his struggles in his early twenties.\n\nAfter the loss of his grandmother in 2024 and a particularly stressful period at work, Anthony began experiencing up to 6 panic attacks a day. Supported by his wife and colleagues, he was referred to NHS talking therapies, something he initially resisted as he wasnâ€™t keen on speaking to a stranger. But over 10-12 sessions, he slowly realised how much relief came from putting his experiences into words. Using tools such as keeping a diary and setting clear goals, he began to understand and manage the physical sensations that once overwhelmed him.\n\nAnthony said: I lived with panic attacks for 20 years, trying to manage it alone, and it impacted every part of my life. The constant worry about when the next panic attack would happen made it really difficult to focus â€“ at work, I couldnâ€™t get through emails or daily tasks, and in my personal life I couldnâ€™t concentrate long enough to read books which was always something that had brought me comfort.\n\nâ€œBut NHS talking therapies changed everything â€“ its broken a cycle I thought Id be stuck in forever. I went from having 6 panic attacks a day at its worst, to just 1 or 2 a month now â€“ I finally feel in control again and am able to concentrate for longer periods, so have even started reading again and joined a book club. If youâ€™re struggling, please donâ€™t wait as long as I did. You only get one life, so be brave enough to put yourself first and get the support you deserve.\n\nIn a new survey of 2,002 adults in England, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of the NHS, nearly half of the public said they did not know anything about social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, while two thirds did not know what body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is.\n\nThe survey found that strong misconceptions around conditions persist â€“ with over a third of the public thinking â€˜most people are a bit OCDâ€™ and nearly 3 in 10 believe PTSD mainly affects military veterans and 1 in 5 think social anxiety is â€˜the same as being shyâ€™.\n\nThe latest NHS talking therapies statistics show that the vast majority of patients referred to the service access treatment within 6 weeks, with 88.6% accessing services within 6 weeks of their referral last year.\n\nAlso speaking out about the benefits of NHS talking therapies as part of the campaign is Phillip Davis, 41 from Cheshire.\n\nPhillip said: â€œI struggled with my mental health a lot in the past. But when I was on my own after my divorce, I realised that if I didnâ€™t do something to help myself, I was going to lose my kids. I was probably going to end up in hospital, because I had tried to overdose once at that point. I thought, I canâ€™t survive like this â€“ I knew I needed help, and I didnâ€™t know what to do on my own.\n\nâ€œEvery session Iâ€™ve had with NHS talking therapies, Iâ€™ve walked out feeling at least a little bit better. They donâ€™t tell you what to do, but they help you find ways to deal with things. Sometimes itâ€™s cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sometimes itâ€™s just a change in outlook â€” like looking at something from a different angle. It helps massively.\n\nâ€œAnd after my last round of talking therapies, when I was also going through employment support, they helped build my self-confidence, and I made some big life choices not long after.\n\nHis message to others is: â€œGet the help thatâ€™s there. I know it can be hard to find, especially for blokes. But it is there, and you should take itâ€.\n\nThe NHS campaign will run for 6 weeks â€‹with adverts showing across TV-on-demand services, online video, radio, digital audio and podcasts, social media and search engines.\n\nNHS talking therapies treatment involves talking to a trained professional in a safe space about your thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and can include methods such as CBT, counselling or guided self-help, depending on the mental health condition.\n\nLatest official statistics , published by NHS England, show that people of working age (16 to 64) are more likely to have a common mental health condition than those aged 75 and over. Prevalence among those aged 16 to 64 was nearly 1 in 4 (22.6%), compared to around 1 in 10 of those aged 75 and over (10.2%).\n\nThe new campaign puts a spotlight on 6 common mental health conditions, which are often mistaken or underplayed, and can be treated by NHS talking therapies.\n\nCommon symptoms for these conditions include:\n\nfrequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours (OCD)\n\nlong-term and overwhelming fear of social situations (social anxiety disorder)\n\ninvoluntarily and vividly reliving traumatic events in the form of flashbacks or nightmares (PTSD)\n\nhaving regular and sudden panic attacks, often for no apparent reason (panic disorder)\n\nhaving an overwhelming and debilitating fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal (phobia)\n\nobsessive thoughts and worry about your appearance (body dysmorphic disorder)\n\nFormer Eastenders actress, Shona McGarty, said: â€œI wasâ€¯always a chatty child, but as I got older, everything changed. Around 15,â€¯I suddenlyâ€¯became painfully self-aware. I started overthinking, struggling to hold conversations, even though talking wasâ€¯literally partâ€¯of my job.\n\nâ€œMy social anxiety would happen when meeting new people, with colleagues or even at family gatherings. My heart would race, my hands would sweat, and sometimes I thought I might faint. I sometimes pretend to receive a phone call just to leave a social situation. People would say, â€œShonaâ€™s so shy,â€ or â€œsheâ€™s so quiet,â€ and it really hurt.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m worlds away from that level of panic now, because Iâ€™ve learned how to deal with it when it shows up. One thing that helps is imagining a little devil on my shoulder. I acknowledge it, and then I answer back: Thank you, but youâ€™re wrong. Iâ€™m in control. Iâ€™m safe. People arenâ€™t judging me; theyâ€™re listening because they want to hear me speak.\n\nâ€œBut the biggest help of all has been talking about it. Acknowledging social anxiety instead of fighting it. Youâ€™d be amazed at how many people feel the same way. A problem shared really is a problem halvedâ€.\n\nFormer professional footballer and mental health campaigner, Clarke Carlisle said: â€œFor over a decade, my PTSD caused me to withdraw not just from the world, but more importantly, from my family. My symptoms would be at their worst over Christmas Id experience flashbacks, traumatic memories and racing thoughts, and feared the lead up to December for many years.\n\nNow, looking at the photo of myself and familyâ€¯celebratingâ€¯my daughterâ€™s 18th birthday during the festive period means the world to me. This was the first winter where I didnt experience symptoms of PTSD but its alsoâ€¯a moment that simplyâ€¯wouldnâ€™tâ€¯exist if Iâ€¯hadnâ€™tâ€¯received treatment for my mental health, allowing me to talk through feelings and getting me to a place where I can spend precious moments with my family again.\n\nTOWIEâ€™s Charlie King said: â€œThe London Landmarks Half Marathon was a real turning point for me. After months of feeling incredibly low and demotivated because of crippling body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), signing up felt overwhelming, and I genuinely didnâ€™t know if Iâ€™d see it through. When my BDD was at its worst, I had become reclusive, Id hide behind a cap, and sometimes even looking at myself in the mirror when brushing my teeth would send me into a spiral. But through therapy, Iâ€™ve come to understand it, understand my thought-patterns and tools to manage it.\n\nCrossing that finish line was the first time in a long time that I felt proud of myself.â€¯ Similar toâ€¯my recovery journey, 13 miles once felt impossible, but taking it step by step showed me that I could keep pushing forward.\n\nâ€œSo, I look at this photo, and I can truly appreciate myself. None of this would have been possible without therapy, and I am really proud of taking the first step.\n\nMedia medic, Dr Nighat Arif GP said: â€œThe new NHS poll reveals a worrying â€˜blind spotâ€™ in public awareness around many common mental health conditions linked to anxiety. This could mean that people are missing out on treatment because they donâ€™t recognise symptoms, are embarrassed by them, or think they are not serious enough to get help for.

Iâ€™d encourage anyone contacted to consider signing up to be part of this ground-breaking study.â€\n\nTen NHS mental health trusts are already supporting the project and anyone over 18 from those areas who has been diagnosed with a severe mental health condition can join.\n\nA total of 49,000 people with mental illnesses are being sought, with 2,000 already enrolled and NHS DigiTrials inviting further eligible patients. Another 1,000 people with dementia will also be included in the study.\n\nGlobalMindsâ€™ Chief Investigator, Professor James Walters from Cardiff University, said : â€œGlobalMinds provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover and identify the many personal and biological factors behind mental health conditions, so researchers can help clinicians and patients by enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis, and making available optimum treatments for all patients.\n\nâ€œPrecision medicine has already revolutionised the treatment of cancer and other rare diseases and we want GlobalMinds to bring the same breakthroughs to mental health. By creating the first large-scale dataset linking both genetic and detailed routine clinical information, GlobalMinds will unlock a new era of personalised mental health care, so we can help tackle the global mental health crisis.â€\n\nThe charity Rethink Mental Illness is also supporting the study and will help raise awareness of the research among people severely affected by mental illness.\n\nBrian Dow, Deputy Chief Executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: â€œThis study has real potential to deepen our understanding and open the door to a new generation of treatmentsâ€¯for mental illness.\n\nâ€œThe strength of the study lies in the partnership between researchers, the NHS and charities like ours, which means data can be powerfully fused with lived experience, with the voices of people experiencing mental illness remaining front and centre.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re delighted to be supporting the study to reach as many people living with severe mental illness as possible.\n\nGlobalMindsâ€¯hasâ€¯alsoâ€¯beenâ€¯designed toâ€¯ensureâ€¯the experience of people taking part is prioritised, with a dedicated Patientâ€¯Public Involvement and Engagement group.\n\nAkeela Mohammed, a GlobalMindsâ€™ Patient Public Involvement and Engagement Adviser and Founder of Healthy Her, a not-for-profit organisation that empowers South Asian women through wellbeing, sport, and community engagement, said :\n\nâ€œIt is vital that research initiatives like GlobalMinds are created from beginning to end with the voices and needs of vulnerable and less included communities at their heart, so that the outcomes benefit as many people as possible.\n\nâ€œThatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve enjoyed providing both my personal experience of mental health and professional insights into the barriers diverse communities face in accessing research, to this groundbreaking study and I cannot wait to see how this people-powered research will transform lives.â€\n\nThe study is supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), with funding from the Wellcome Trust and Johnson \u0026 Johnson.\n\nAnyone aged over 18, who is living with a diagnosed severe mental health condition and lives in participating areas, can sign up at: globalminds.org \n\nFor the GlobalMinds study, eligible patients are being invited to participate and no ones data is shared with researchers without their knowledge and permission.\n\nFurther information\n\nMore information about Global Minds is available here: globalminds.org \n\nGlobalMinds is open to anyone aged 18 or over with a diagnosis of Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Major Depression, or a related condition who live in an area with a participating NHS Trust.

Thatâ€™s not happening by chance â€“ itâ€™s because we delivered record levels of care in 2025.\n\nâ€œThis progress is driven by unprecedented investment and modernisation of our health service, and above all by the dedication of NHS staff.\n\nâ€œWhether itâ€™s by opening up new community diagnostic centres, rolling out surgical hubs to tackle backlogs, or investing in modern equipment and technology, we are rebuilding our NHS.\n\nâ€œThereâ€™s so much more to do, but people can take hope and optimism from the fact that the NHS is finally on the road to recovery.â€\n\nYellow cold health alerts for England have been issued by the UK Health Security Agency for either side of the weekend â€“ with temperatures expected to drop from tomorrow until the start of next week (Friday 13 to Monday 16 February), as temperatures have fallen in recent days to drop below freezing which could lead to increased pressure on hospitals, especially by vulnerable people.\n\nDate published : 12 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 12 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nElective care \nWinter news and guidance",

There were also still more than 900 patients (904) on average in hospital each day last week with the bug.\n\nThere were also almost 4,000 more calls (3,878) received by NHS 111 services (381,479) compared to the same week last year (377,601).\n\nFlu rates continue to drop since last monthâ€™s peak, but there was still an average of almost 1,500 (1,491) patients in hospital with flu and an average of 630 patients in hospital with COVID-19 per day last week.\n\nVaccination data shows 18.8 million flu vaccines have been delivered since the autumn/winter campaign began â€“ around half a million more than at the same point last year, helping to keep more people out of hospital and protected against getting seriously ill from the virus.\n\nOn Monday (2 February 2026) the government announced that from April the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine will be offered to additional groups most vulnerable to serious outcomes from infection, specifically adults aged 80 years and over and all residents in care homes for older adults.\n\nPeople turning 75 or who are between 75 and 79 as well as pregnant women can come forward now for their jab and get protected.\n\nNHS National Medical Director Professor Meghana Pandit said: â€œEarly NHS preparation and planning for winter is paying off for patients.\n\nâ€œPatients are being handed over from ambulances quicker, even amid high demand on services with more handovers last month than any January since before the pandemic.\n\nâ€œHigher vaccination rates are helping to limit the impact of winter viruses like flu, though cases of the vomiting bug are still high in hospitals, which staff are working extremely hard to keep under control.\n\nâ€œVaccinations remain the best protection available from seasonal viruses, so if you are eligible for your flu, COVID-19 or RSV jab please come forwardâ€.\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said: â€œBy planning for winter earlier than ever before, weâ€™re now seeing real improvements in urgent and emergency care.

Ambulances are handing over faster, delays are coming down and flu is taking up fewer hospital beds than last year, even with demand running at near-record levels. Thatâ€™s real progress, driven by the dedication of frontline staff and better preparation than ever before.\n\nâ€œWe backed that effort with Â£450 million for urgent and emergency care, 500 new ambulances on the road and millions of vaccinations delivered this winter for flu, Covid and RSV, keeping people protected and out of hospital.\n\nâ€œWinter pressures havenâ€™t gone away, but the NHS is meeting them head on. If youâ€™re eligible, get vaccinated, follow public health advice and help us keep the service there for everyone who needs it.â€\n\nAmy Douglas, Lead Epidemiologist at UKHSA, said :Norovirus activity has remained high in recent weeks, particularly among those aged 65 years and over and is now rising in children aged under 5 years too. Outbreaks in hospital settings have increased too, so please remember the simple steps we can all take to stop norovirus spreading.\n\nâ€œWashing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will also help stop infections from spreading. Alcohol gels do not kill norovirus so donâ€™t rely on these alone.\n\nâ€œIf you have diarrhoea and vomiting, donâ€™t return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped and donâ€™t prepare food for others in that time either. If you are unwell, avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to prevent passing on the infection to those most vulnerable.â€\n\nThe weekly situation report publications can be found here:Â  Statistics Â» Urgent and Emergency Care Daily Situation Reports 2025-26 \n\nDate published : 29 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 6 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nWinter news and guidance",

TheÂ programmeÂ is expected to diagnose up to 50,000 cancers by 2035 and at least 23,000 at an earlier stage, potentially saving thousands of lives.\n\nProfessor Peter Johnson, NHS Englandâ€™s National Clinical Director for Cancer, said :Â â€œWaiting to find out if you might have cancer is incredibly stressful for patients and their families.\n\nâ€œOur lung cancer screeningÂ programmeÂ means that we are picking up more cancers at an early stage than ever, and by bringing AI and robotics together in this trailblazing NHS pilot, weâ€™re bringing in the very latest technology to give clinicians a clearer look inside the lungs and support faster, more accurate biopsies.\n\nâ€œThis is a glimpse of the future of cancer detection. Innovation like this is exactly how we can help diagnose more cancers faster, so treatment can be most effective, and why the NHS continues to lead the way in bringingÂ new technologyÂ safely into frontline care.â€\n\nWes Streeting, Health and Social Care Secretary, said: Â â€œWhen I was diagnosed with kidney cancer, the NHS saved my life using robotic technology. That experience showed me whats possible when brilliant clinicians have access toÂ cutting-edgeÂ innovation â€“ it saves lives.\n\nâ€œLung cancer is one of the biggest killers in the UK, taking an extra year of peopleâ€™s lives in the poorest parts of the country. This pilot will help to catch it earlier, replacing weeks of invasive testing with a single targeted procedure. For patients waiting anxiously for answers, this speed and precision can beÂ life-changing.\n\nâ€œThis is our National Cancer PlanÂ in action â€“ shifting from late diagnosis to early intervention and from analogue to digital, ensuring every patient can benefit from the blend of human care alongside game changing technology, no matter where they live.â€\n\nDr Anne Rigg, Medical Director for Cancer and Surgery at Guyâ€™s and St Thomasâ€™ NHS Foundation Trust, said : â€œThis pilot brings together artificial intelligence and robotic technology as genuinely disruptive tools to simplify and shorten the lung cancer diagnostic pathway. By combining AI-enabled risk stratification with highly precise robotic biopsy, we are reducing delays and unnecessary steps to diagnosis.\n\nâ€œCrucially, this work is being co-designed with patients and frontline clinical teams, ensuring that the pathway is not only faster, but safer, moreÂ equitable, andÂ centredÂ on the patient experience. By improving access to advancedÂ diagnosticsÂ we can help reduce variation in care for all patients, regardless of where they are referred from.\n\nâ€œTogether, these changes have the potential to support earlier diagnosis and treatment for more patients, which is fundamental to improving long-term outcomes in lung cancer.â€\n\nOne person who has alreadyÂ benefitedÂ from an earlier identification of lung cancer via the NHS pilot is David Lindsay, an IT contractor from Streatham, London.Â  David discovered he had stage 1 lung cancer after being referred to Guyâ€™s Hospital for a suspected deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) in his left leg in September 2025. Imaging tests revealed an incidental finding of a nodule on the lung. David had a robotic bronchoscopy to take a tissue sample which confirmed early-stage lung cancer â€“ a primary adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe. This was followed by robotic, lung-sparing surgery, which is less invasive, to removeÂ the cancer.\n\nDavid said :Â â€œThe efficient staff scheduled me in for the bronchoscopy in the morning and I went home in the evening. It was quick and painless. IÂ wasnâ€™tÂ worried because all the staff made me feel comfortable and assured.\n\nâ€œThey clearly explained the findings and after a comprehensive discussion, it was agreed that removal ofÂ the cancerÂ was the bestÂ optionÂ in this instance. The operation was a success.\n\nâ€œThe deep vein thrombosis was a blessing in disguise because if itÂ hadnâ€™tÂ occurred, IÂ wouldnâ€™tÂ have had the scan, and various tests, and theyÂ wouldnâ€™tÂ have seen the cancer. Who knows when I would have had another check-up, and the next time, the cancer may have reached stage 4.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m very grateful and appreciate the work that the NHS and wonderful staff do every day.â€\n\nThe pilot is being led by Guyâ€™s and St Thomasâ€™ NHS Foundation Trust, following successful testing. The team has already carried out around 300 robotic biopsy procedures, with 215 people going on to receive cancer treatment, while others were spared more complex procedures after benign results.\n\nTechnology Secretary Liz Kendall said :Emerging technologies like robotics and AI will be a game-changer for so many people speeding up access to treatment and delivering improved outcomes for patients which would have been unthinkable even a few short years ago.\n\nâ€œThis is what it means to be a world leader in technology leaving no stone unturned to make sure it delivers for every community and that its potential is being harnessed to deliver cutting-edge services which change lives for the better.\n\nFrom January, the pilot formally launches at Guyâ€™s and St Thomasâ€™,Â with planned expansion to Kingâ€™s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, allowing more patients referred with suspected lung cancer toÂ benefitÂ from theÂ new approach.\n\nDr Jesme Fox, Medical Director at the charity Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, said : We welcome the announcement of this pilot project at Guys and St Thomass, using AI and robotic technology to more accurately and more quickly diagnose lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer, for many, remains a devastating disease. These initiatives mean that more people affected by this disease, will be picked up earlier, be diagnosed faster and so have a better outcome from treatment.\n\nWe are delighted that the 2030 timeline for the full roll out of the Lung Cancer Screening Programme in England, has been reaffirmed. Screening for people at high risk of lung cancer, with low dose CT chest scans, works. The Programme has already saved thousands of lives, by picking up lung cancer in the early stage, when curative treatment is possible.\n\nSo, if you receive an invitation to take part in the Lung Cancer Screening Programme, do not ignore it.\n\nIf successful, the pilot will help the NHS generate evidence to develop a national commissioning policy for robotic bronchoscopy, supporting more consistent access to the technology across the NHS in future.\n\nFurther information\n\nthe pilot is funded through the NHS Cancer Programme â€“ Innovation Open Call (SBRI Healthcare) \n\nthis is the first NHS pilot to integrate Optellumâ€™s AI risk stratification with Intuitiveâ€™s Ion robotic bronchoscopy in a single end-to-end lung cancer diagnostic pathway\n\nOptellumâ€™s Virtual Nodule Clinic is already used across multiple NHS organisations to support lung nodule assessment\n\nthe Ion robotic bronchoscopy system uses an ultra-thin, shape-sensing tube to navigate deep into the lung and take precise biopsy samples\n\nfull evaluation will assess patient and service outcomes; claims relating to survival, waiting times or cost-effectiveness will follow once the pilot is complete\n\nNHS data shows that since the targeted lung health checks initiative began in 2021, early diagnosis rates for lung cancer have grown more rapidly in the most disadvantaged areas\n\nDate published : 27 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 6 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer \nInnovation",

This is another step in the road on our journey to shift our NHS from analogue to digital. \n\nGenevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said: â€œThis is great news for people living in England. This change marks an important moment for bowel cancer screening in the country. \n\nâ€œIncreasing the sensitivity of the test means more cancers will be prevented and found earlier, saving more lives from the UKâ€™s fourth most common cancer.â€Â Â  \n\nMichelle Mitchell, chief executive at Cancer Research UK, said: This vital step from NHS England to lower the threshold for further tests after bowel screening will save lives. It means more cancers will be detected at an earlier stage, when treatment is more likely to be successful, while also preventing some from developing in the first place. \n\nBowel cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer death in England, so its crucial that progress like this continues. \n\nScreening is for people without symptoms, so if anyone spots something that isnt right for them, they should speak to their GP. It probably wont be cancer, but if it is, finding it early can make a real difference. \n\nBowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK for both men and women, and the fourth overall, but screening can catch it early â€” often before any symptoms appear. \n\nMost people who complete their test will not need further checks, but for those who do, early action can be life-saving. It is estimated that, currently, around 2 in 100 people who take part in bowel screening will require further testing â€“ this is expected to increase to 3 in 100 following the lowering of the threshold. \n\nFor patients, the test itself does not change and remains simple. FIT tests are done at home by putting a sample of poo in a small tube and returning it by post to the NHS for testing. \n\nOnce fully implemented, testing at the lower threshold is expected to reduce late-stage diagnoses and deaths from bowel cancer by around six per cent â€“ while preventing and detecting more cancers earlier will also save the NHS Â£32 million each year. \n\nThe roll-out follows a pilot at eight early-adopting services, where closer working between NHS screening and diagnostic teams has helped more people get checked sooner, with over 60 additional cancers and nearly 500 high-risk polyps being found and treated. \n\nIn line with recommendations by the UK National Screening Committee, the NHS will now roll out the lower threshold across the country by March 2028. \n\nIvan, a personal trainer who felt fit and healthy, nearly ignored his bowel screening test. He said: â€œI felt fit, healthy and busy, and I kept putting my bowel screening test off. Cancer wasnâ€™t something I thought would affect me. When I finally sent the test back, it picked up a problem that led to further checks and my diagnosis. \n\nâ€œIâ€™m convinced that doing the test when I did changed everything â€” and if Iâ€™d left it any longer, it could have been a very different story. If your test is sitting in a drawer, donâ€™t put it off. Send it back.â€ \n\nAt the same time, the NHS is making bowel screening easier to take part in, with digital alerts being introduced from February through the NHS App to make people aware that a home testing kit is on its way. The alerts will let people know what to expect, making it easier to complete the test promptly. \n\nAnyone that requires letter sent by post, including anyone newly eligible for bowel cancer screening, will continue to receive them. \n\nThe NHS rolled out digital communications for cervical screening last year as part of a new â€˜ping and bookâ€™ service . So far nearly nine in ten women have received screening invites and reminders digitally, making screening quicker, more convenient and less reliant on paper. \n\nThe new functionality comes as record numbers â€“ nearly 40 million people in England â€“ are now using the NHS App to manage their health quickly and conveniently. \n\nLast year, the NHS also completed the expansion of bowel cancer screening to everyone aged 50 to 74, with over 4 million more people invited since roll out began in 2021. \n\nThe NHS is urging everyone eligible to act promptly when their test or digital invite arrives â€“ completing the test promptly can mean simpler treatment, better recovery, or avoiding cancer altogether. \n\nDate published : 26 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 23 January, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer",

More than 12,000 people have already received additional bowel screening after being identified as at higher risk through the Lynch syndrome register.\n\nColonoscopy screening can detect and remove precancerous polyps or catch cancer at an early stage when it is treatable and curable.\n\nExpanding the use of genomic testing to identify people at risk of certain cancers and enabling more cancers to be caught earlier will be a major part of the upcoming National Cancer Plan to modernise cancer care for future generations.\n\nSecretary of State for Health and Social Care Wes Streeting said: â€œ1 in every 2 people will get cancer in their lifetime but that does not mean the chances are random â€“ many people face a higher risk through the genes they inherit.\n\nâ€œAnd while we cannot do anything about inherited genes we can do something about what we do with that information.\n\nâ€œAlongside record levels of investment I am determined to modernise our NHS so it is fit for the 21st century. By launching this world-leading genetic register for people with genetic conditions with an increased risk of cancer, we can provide personalised and preventative care sooner.\n\nâ€œThis register wont just supercharge innovation â€“ it will be life changing and life-saving, allowing the NHS to develop individual care, fast-track screening and tailored information to enable more cancers to be caught earlier.\n\nProfessor Dame Sue Hill, Chief Scientific Officer for England and Senior Responsible Officer for Genomics in the NHS, said: â€œGenomics is becoming an integral part of how we diagnose and treat cancer across the NHS.\n\nâ€œThrough the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, genetic testing is already offered where it provides clear clinical benefit, and the 10 Year Health Plan sets out a clear ambition to embed genomics more routinely across care pathways. The National Cancer Plan will build on that work, strengthening how genomic testing is used across cancer treatment and individual patient journeys.\n\nâ€œBy bringing inherited cancer risk information together in a single national programme, we can support more systematic follow-up, improve the targeting of screening and surveillance, and ensure genomic insights are used more effectively to support earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.â€\n\nCharlie Grinstead, 32, from London, a civil engineer, was able to access personalised treatment sooner thanks to genetic testing via the NHS Lynch syndrome register.\n\nCharlie was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2020, aged 26. He underwent surgery to remove the tumour followed by chemotherapy and other targeted treatments. After genetic testing, he was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome and started targeted immunotherapy treatment.\n\nHe said: â€œI tried 3 different chemotherapy drugs and none of them seemed to be working â€“ it was a rollercoaster of side effects and the drugs not really doing anything, but my Lynch Syndrome diagnosis unlocked the door to have immunotherapy treatment â€“ and proved to be the key to my recovery. It was incredibly effective, almost from day 1, and the side-effects were non-existent compared to the chemotherapy, I thought I was taking a placebo because the side effects just werenâ€™t there.\n\nâ€œIt was an absolute game-changer and stopped the cancer from spreading. I now no longer need treatment, and itâ€™s been a huge relief to finish treatment â€“ there is a risk the cancer could return but I have regular scans to monitor it. Iâ€™m now able to make plans for the future â€“ enjoying precious time with my wife and son, and am just incredibly grateful to spend time with family and friends.â€\n\nThe NHS National Inherited Cancer Predisposition Register is managed by NHS Englandâ€™s National Disease Registration Service.\n\nThe NHS Genomics Population Health Service as outlined in the NHS 10 Year Health Plan will support the expansion of genomic testing for high-risk groups over the next 10 years.\n\nFor background\n\nFrom July 2023 to November 2025, 12,245 people with Lynch syndrome have received additional bowel screening.\n\nDate published : 24 January, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 23 January, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer",

The spirometry will have been performed as part of routine clinical care at their GP, or local hub/diagnostic centre, for suspected COPD. As part of the study, the spirometry trace will be independently reported by two reporters, with a third review for any traces with discrepancies between reporters.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpirometry reporting will take place via a web form and can be done atÂ  flexible timesÂ  to suit your own schedule. You will be paidÂ  Â£10 per traceÂ  reported. We would like reporters to commit to reporting 25 or more traces over the next six months, but there is also potential to do more if you wish. Reporting will generally follow ARTP reporting standards but full guidance will be given on study-specific reporting requirements and how to complete the reporting form.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease contactÂ  cormorant@phc.ox.ac.uk Â if you have further questions or to express interest â€“ please include the following information:\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName\n\r\nE-mail address\n\r\nARTP spirometry register number (must be current)\n\r\nProfessional background e.g. physiologist, nurse, pharmacist\n\r\nCurrent setting of work e.g. GP practice, outpatient clinic\n\r\nNumber of spirometry traces you currently report per month (on average, approximately)\n\r\nEstimated number of traces you would like to report for the CORMORANT study over the next 6 months (between 25 and 150)\n\r\nAny involvement that you have already with the CORMORANT study e.g. as a study site\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this and considering if you can support this request.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nARTP have posted this on behalf of University of Oxford\n\r\nAll enquiries relating to this email, are to be sent to the email address above \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView other News \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernance Advisory Council \nCommittees \nGoverning Documents \nAssociation Policies \u0026 Reports \n\nStrategy Education Strategy \nWorkforce Strategy \nQuality Assurance Strategy \nInnovation Strategy \n\nLatest News \nHistory Leadership \u0026 Workforce \nEducation \u0026 Training \nScience \u0026 Technology \n\nARTP Membership Why Join? \nMembership \u0026 Fees \nCorporate Membership \nReciprocal Membership with ERS \nYour Application Status \n\nAwards Honorary Fellowship \nFellowship \nSpecial Awards \n\nIndustry ARTP Corporate Members \nInsourcing \u0026 Community Provider Charter",

The statement is also endorsed by ARNS.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nThis guidance is intended to simplify practice for healthcare professionals performing and reporting spirometry by removing the need to apply different predicted equations for different populations.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nMost spirometers that meet ISO Technical Standard 26782 already have the GLI Global equations available built into their software. However availability may depend on the age of the spirometer and the service agreement in place. We recommend that healthcare providers contact their manufacturer to confirm what options are available.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nFor healthcare providers using spirometers that do not meet ISO 26782, it is strongly recommended that new compliant devices are purchased.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nWhere spirometers meet the technical standard but do not yet have the GLI Global equations available, selecting GLI â€˜Otherâ€™ category is an acceptable alternative until updates become more widely available.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nWhere there are concerns regarding longitudinal data, including the recalculation of previous results, it will be important to also provide the absolute values for comparison. These can be used to assess if there has been any significant change in lung function parameters. It is also important to remember that spirometry is only part of the diagnostic and management pathway.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nThis position statement does not affect candidates currently undertaking spirometry certification. Candidates should continue to collect evidence and prepare for their OSCE as normal. Any future changes to the spirometry certification process will be communicated widely. The next edition of the ARTP spirometry newsletter will include some discussion around this topic. There is a plan to run a webinar in the future as well.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nColleagues in primary care who have questions about the implications of this position statement are encouraged to contact their local hospital lung function department which may be able to offer guidance support, or spirometry training providers. Healthcare professionals listed on the ARTP Spirometry Register also have access to a clinical expert via theÂ spirometry portal,Â who can provide advice and guidance on next steps.\n\r\n\r\nClick here to download the position statement\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView other News \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernance Advisory Council \nCommittees \nGoverning Documents \nAssociation Policies \u0026 Reports \n\nStrategy Education Strategy \nWorkforce Strategy \nQuality Assurance Strategy \nInnovation Strategy \n\nLatest News \nHistory Leadership \u0026 Workforce \nEducation \u0026 Training \nScience \u0026 Technology \n\nARTP Membership Why Join? \nMembership \u0026 Fees \nCorporate Membership \nReciprocal Membership with ERS \nYour Application Status \n\nAwards Honorary Fellowship \nFellowship \nSpecial Awards \n\nIndustry ARTP Corporate Members \nInsourcing \u0026 Community Provider Charter",

The current policy climate shows that there is a needÂ to continue to raise the profile of respiratory and make the case for investment, support, and attention to ensure that people with lung conditions â€“ and those who care for them â€“ get the support they need. TheÂ Governmentâ€™s recently announced Major Conditions Strategy, with a focus on chronic respiratory disease, will provide an opportunity to make this case.Â \n\r\n\n\r\nIn 2023, we will be continuing to push for improvements and change through our three working groups and the Taskforce more widely. Key priorities will include:Â \n\r\n\n\r\n- Spirometry - Increasing access to spirometry lung function testing so that everyone gets a quick and accurate diagnosisÂ \n\r\n- Inhaler technique checks Â - Improving inhaler techniques to ensure people with lung conditions are confident using their medicationÂ \n\r\n- Community Pharmacy Â - Making full use of community pharmacy to help people manage their lung conditions betterÂ \n\r\n- Workforce - Ensuring the right medical professionals are in place to meet the needs of respiratory patients now and in the future As ever, we owe our success to those that dedicate their time and insight to support the Taskforce and drive our work forward. The commitment of our Taskforce, Industries Forum and working groups members creates invaluable discussion and spurs on real progress. We are especially grateful to our patient and carer representatives, whose contributions highlight the importance of Taskforceâ€™s mission and give vital focus to all the work we do.Â \n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for your continued support for the Taskforce in 2022 and we look forward to all that we can achieve together in 2023.Â \n\r\n\n\r\nTaskforce for Lung Health \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView other News \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernance Advisory Council \nCommittees \nGoverning Documents \nAssociation Policies \u0026 Reports \n\nStrategy Education Strategy \nWorkforce Strategy \nQuality Assurance Strategy \nInnovation Strategy \n\nLatest News \nHistory Leadership \u0026 Workforce \nEducation \u0026 Training \nScience \u0026 Technology \n\nARTP Membership Why Join? \nMembership \u0026 Fees \nCorporate Membership \nReciprocal Membership with ERS \nYour Application Status \n\nAwards Honorary Fellowship \nFellowship \nSpecial Awards \n\nIndustry ARTP Corporate Members \nInsourcing \u0026 Community Provider Charter",

June 2025\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition Statement on race-neutral spirometry reference equations. June 2025\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26 June 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) Network is a European Respiratory Society Clinical Research Collaboration that aims to improve how lung function tests are interpreted. The network published GLI multi-ethnic spirometry reference equations in 2012, and those equations were subsequently endorsed by all the major respiratory societies including the ARTP. At the time it was the most comprehensive set of lung function reference data and aimed to present a unified and global approach for the interpretation of spirometry measurements. Over this past decade, the GLI network has continued to work on improving lung function interpretation.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the 2012 GLI publication, the limitations of self-reported race/ethnicity were acknowledged, as were the limitation of the categories. At the time, these were considered better than using an all-White reference population. More recent evidence has shown that the role of social and environmental determinants of lung function differences between ethnic groups had been previously underestimated, such that applying reference equations for different ethnic groups may, in fact, negatively impact assessment of disease severity. A new â€œGLI Globalâ€ reference equation, which eliminates the use of ethnicity as a factor in interpreting lung function, has now been published. The use of this race-neutral approach is a first step towards mitigating health inequalities in lung function between ethnic groups.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe GLI Global equations have already been endorsed by the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society but are not yet widely established in the UK. The ARTP have given careful consideration and recognise this is a contrast to years of a race specific approach. The re-evaluation is not unique to respiratory medicine; other societies and professional bodies are recognising that race used elsewhere in clinical algorithms may have perpetuated health inequalities and are revising guidance where possible. With this in mind, and after careful deliberation, the ARTP are endorsing the use of the 2022 GLI Global reference equations.\n\r\n\n\r\nA switch to GLI Global requires more thoughtful consideration of the inherent uncertainty and limitations to any reference equation. The use of GLI Global to interpret spirometry requires consideration of an individualâ€™s symptoms and clinical history, and it should be remembered that spirometry is not the only part of a diagnosis or clinical decision making. Further information on the considerations when switching to these equations and some of the frequently asked questions are discussed further within the statement, which can be accessed below.\n\r\n\r\nClick here to download the position statement Â \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView other News \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernance Advisory Council \nCommittees \nGoverning Documents \nAssociation Policies \u0026 Reports \n\nStrategy Education Strategy \nWorkforce Strategy \nQuality Assurance Strategy \nInnovation Strategy \n\nLatest News \nHistory Leadership \u0026 Workforce \nEducation \u0026 Training \nScience \u0026 Technology \n\nARTP Membership Why Join? \nMembership \u0026 Fees \nCorporate Membership \nReciprocal Membership with ERS \nYour Application Status \n\nAwards Honorary Fellowship \nFellowship \nSpecial Awards \n\nIndustry ARTP Corporate Members \nInsourcing \u0026 Community Provider Charter",

Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, often without realising it as it has no symptoms. If left undiagnosed, high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes, so the more people who get their blood pressure checked the better.\n\nâ€œThese search term stats show us that there is growing awareness of key cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol. These conditions can cause serious illness if left unaddressed, but the good news is theyâ€™re manageable.\n\nâ€œSimple steps like being active and cutting down on foods high in fat, salt and sugar can make a big difference, and medication can help if needed. Checking your blood pressure or cholesterol level is quick and easy and it could be one of the most important things you do for your heart health.â€\n\nThose aged 40 to 74 who do not have a pre-existing health condition, will be invited to an NHS Health Check by their GP every five years. The check-up will usually be done by a health care professional at your local GP practice.\n\nCOVID-19 remained the most viewed condition on the NHS website in 2025, with 2.3 million visits, but this was a drop of 38% compared with 2024.\n\nOther common conditions included in the top 10 visited health conditions on NHS.UK were urinary tract infections, chickenpox, high cholesterol, and shingles.\n\nHigh cholesterol remained the fifth most viewed condition in 2025, with 1.7 million visits, while searches for iron deficiency anaemia and piles (haemorrhoids) also appeared in the top 10.\n\nVisits to childhood infections such as hand, foot and mouth disease and chickenpox fell compared with 2024 but still attracted over a million views each.\n\nThe NHS is reminding people that the nhs.uk website is available 24/7, with clear guidance on symptoms, treatment options, and when to seek further help.\n\nThe NHS website, managed by NHS England, is the UKâ€™s largest health website, providing information on hundreds of conditions and advice on accessing NHS services and preventive care such as NHS Health Checks .\n\nThe 10 most viewed health conditions on the NHS website in 2025 were:\n\nCOVID-19 (2.3 million)\n\nHigh blood pressure (2.0 million)\n\nUrinary tract infection (1.9 million)\n\nChickenpox (1.8 million)\n\nHigh cholesterol (1.7 million)\n\nShingles (1.6 million)\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (1.4 million)\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease (1.4 million)\n\nIron deficiency anaemia (1.3 million)\n\nPiles (haemorrhoids) (1.3 million)\n\nÂ Further information\n\nYou can get a free blood pressure check if you are aged 40 or over and live in England\n\nThe NHS Health Check is a free check of the health of your heart and blood vessels if you are aged 40-74 without a pre-existing condition by your GP or local council every 5 years\n\nIf you think you are eligible but have not been invited, contact your GP surgery to find out if they offer NHS Health Checks or contact your local council to find out where you can get an NHS Health Check in your area.\n\nDate published : 21 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 20 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nHeart disease \nPatient care",

In some people, it can appear or worsen due to factors including illness, stress or skin injury.\n\nThe treatment works by calming the immune response that causes colour to be lost, allowing skin tone to gradually return.\n\nUntil now, options have been limited mostly to interventions that camouflage the condition or steroid creams that can thin and damage the skin if used long-term. Light therapy is also offered, but it requires repeated hospital visits and does not always produce lasting results.\n\nProfessor Meghana Pandit, National Medical Director at NHS England, said:Â  â€œFor many people, vitiligo isnâ€™t just a change in skin colour â€“ it can affect how they see themselves and how they feel every day, particularly when it involves the face.\n\nâ€œWe also know the condition can have a particularly significant impact on people with darker skin tones, where changes in pigmentation are more visible.\n\nâ€œFor the first time, we now have an approved treatment available on the NHS that can significantly restore skin colour rather than simply covering the condition up. While it wonâ€™t be right for everyone, for some people this could make a profound difference to how they feel about themselves.â€\n\nThe cream had previously been rejected for NHS use in August 2025, but following a rapid review and complex negotiations, NHS England secured a deal with manufacturer Incyte to enable its approval today by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).\n\nCallum Pickering , 41, an electrical design engineer from Ipswich first noticed a small white patch on his knee when he was 10 years old. As he grew older, the vitiligo spread across his body and face; accelerated, Callum believes, by the trauma of losing a close school friend.\n\nIn his younger years, Callum spent hours trying to camouflage the white patches on his skin and into adulthood has found the appearance of vitiligo on the back of his head and hands a real challenge.\n\nCallum said:Â  â€œIâ€™ve learned to live with it and accept it more. Iâ€™m confident talking about it, but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not self-conscious. People double-take. Some try not to look, others just stare.\n\nâ€œA treatment that really works and is available to everyone who wants it would make such a difference. Some people are happy to embrace it, and thatâ€™s great. But for me, if something could help, it would be life-changingâ€.\n\nAbigail Hurrell, CEO of The Vitiligo Society said: For more than 40 years, The Vitiligo Society has campaigned relentlessly for effective, evidenceâ€‘based treatment options for people living with vitiligo. Todayâ€™s approval of ruxolitinib represents a historic milestone and the first time the NHS has recognised and funded a dedicated re-pigmentation treatment.\n\nThis decision acknowledges the significant psychological, social and medical impact of vitiligo and marks a fundamental shift towards the equitable care our community has long deserved.\n\nâ€œWe are profoundly grateful to the individuals who shared their lived experiences and helped elevate this issue to national attention. Their voices were instrumental in achieving this outcome, alongside constructive collaboration from NICE, NHS England, clinicians, researchers and industry partners.\n\nAs we move into this new era with further innovations on the horizon, The Vitiligo Society remains fully committed to ensuring that everyone in the UK has access to the best possible vitiligo treatment options available, both now and in the years ahead.â€\n\nAs with any medicine, it can cause side effects, most commonly mild reactions at the site where the cream is applied, such as redness or irritation.\n\nDate published : 24 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 23 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nMedicine \nPatient care",

There is still much more to do, and well redouble our efforts to make sure this improvement continuesâ€.\n\nDate published : 26 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 27 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nUrgent and emergency care \nVaccination",
