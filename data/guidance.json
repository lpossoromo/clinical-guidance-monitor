                                     "content":  "Hundreds of thousands more women attended NHS breast screening last year and thousands more cancers were diagnosed early in England. \n\nNew figures today show that in 2024/25, 1.94 million women aged 50 to 70 attended screening within six months of invitation â€“ up nearly 200,000 (193,745) from 1.75 million the previous year.\n\nAs a result, nearly 20,000 cancers (19,291) were detected â€“ 9 cases in every 1,000 women screened â€“ which is up almost 16% on the previous year, when 16,677 cancers were diagnosed through NHS breast screening.\n\nThis means thousands more women were able to access treatment earlier, when there are more options available and treatment is more likely to be effective.\n\nEncouragingly, attendance among women invited for screening for the first time reached 63.6% â€“ the highest level in a decade â€“ with 4.79 million eligible women now up to date with their breast screening â€“ also a ten-year high.\n\nOverall, around 71.8% of eligible women are now up to date with screening under the programmeâ€™s three-year standard, up 1.8 percentage points on last year.\n\nDespite this progress, the latest statistics from the NHS Breast Screening Programme show that around three in ten women did not take up the offer of screening.\n\nLocal screening services are working with NHS England to improve uptake, including targeted outreach in lower-attending areas, reminder texts and expanded use of mobile screening units to bring services closer to home.\n\nThe NHS also launched its first-ever national breast screening campaign in February last year to support even more women to come forward.\n\nBacked by charities including Breast Cancer Now, the campaign featured public figures including Victoria Derbyshire, Julia Bradbury and Shirley Ballas who all shared personal messages to encourage women to attend.\n\nDuring the campaign period, the NHS saw a huge increase in people accessing information online, with tens of thousands of women visiting NHS breast screening pages in a single week and clicks to the screening service finder rising sharply.\n\nDr Harrison Carter, Director of Screening at NHS England, said : â€œBreast screening can save lives. With nearly 20,000 cancers detected early through screening last year, itâ€™s encouraging to see more women attending, especially those invited for the first time, because making screening a habit can help protect your health for years to come.â€\n\nâ€œBut we know there are a range of reasons why some women donâ€™t come forward and there is much more still to do to support more women to access breast screening. If you receive an invitation, please donâ€™t ignore it. Itâ€™s an appointment that could save your life.â€\n\nPhilomena, whose breast cancer was detected through routine screening, said she nearly ignored her invitation before deciding to attend: â€œEncouraging women to attend their breast screening appointment is something that I am extremely passionate about, as I know how much it matters. Iâ€™ve lost friends who might still be here if their cancer had been found earlier, and I very nearly ignored my own screening invitation, too. At the time, I didnâ€™t want to disrupt a new job I loved, but that small delay could have cost me everything.\n\nWhen I finally went for my mammogram, it led to the early detection of stage 2 breast cancer. Hearing those words was devastating, but catching it early meant I had a fighting chance. Treatment was challenging, but it gave me my life back, and it strengthened my commitment to raising awareness about the importance of breast screening in my community.\n\nScreening is quick, free, and could be the difference between catching cancer early or too late. Please make the time for your appointment. Prioritising your health isnâ€™t selfish itâ€™s essential. My screening saved my life, and it could save yours too.â€\n\nWomen aged 50 up to the age of 71 are invited for breast screening every three years, with appointments provided locally through clinics and mobile units.\n\nBreast screening does have some risks. Some women who have screening will be diagnosed and treated for slow-growing breast cancers that may never otherwise have been found or caused them harm. Mammograms also do not always find a cancer that is there, but most people feel the benefits of breast screening outweigh the possible risks.\n\nRead more about NHS plans for breast screening .\n\nAdditional information\n\n3-year screening coverage (women screened within 36 months): 71.8%, up 1.8 percentage points on 2023/24\n\noverall uptake (aged 50â€“70): 70.6%, up from 70.0% last year\n\ninvitations issued: 2.75 million (around 10% increase)\n\nwomen screened (routine programme): 1.94 million women aged 50â€“70 attended screening within six months of invitation, up from 1.75 million the previous year\n\noverall screening activity: 2.15 million women aged 45+ were screened in 2024/25, a 10.3% increase on 2023/24\n\ncancers detected through screening: 19,291 (rate of 9.0 per 1,000 screened)\n\nfirst-invite uptake: 63.6%, the highest level in 10 years\n\nfollowing the national campaign launch, NHS breast screening advice pages recorded more than 32,000 visits in one week, a 145% increase\n\nall figures relate to the 2024/25 NHS Breast Screening Programme annual statistics \n\nDate published : 19 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 19 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nCancer \nPatient care",

Anyone can self-refer online without needing to see their GP or have an already diagnosed mental health condition.\n\nDr Adrian James, NHS Englandâ€™s National Medical Director for Mental Health and Neurodiversity said: â€œWhile itâ€™s encouraging that thousands more people facing mental health conditions are accessing NHS support than before the pandemic, we know that millions more could benefit from vital NHS talking therapies.\n\nâ€œThis landmark new campaign is a critical step to ensuring that everyone struggling with challenging but very common conditions like anxiety and PTSD knows that there is support available to help them get on with their lives again.\n\nâ€œThrough proven treatment and support available for free on the NHS, these conditions can be overcome to help people return to work, regain confidence or feel back to their old selves in social situations.\n\nâ€œOur message is clear, if youâ€™re struggling with your mental health, NHS talking therapies are here for you, and you can either self-refer or speak with your local GP practiceâ€.\n\nJo, 40, a data engineer based in Solihull in the West Midlands, has been treated by NHS talking therapies after living undiagnosed with PTSD for years.\n\nAt just 22, Jo received a devastating cancer diagnosis and was given months to live, unless a matching stem cell donor could be found. She began to prepare emotionally for her death â€“ but, against the odds, a donor was found, and she underwent a life-saving transplant. Jo spent her 30s rebuilding herself and moving forward in her life, but her resilience was tested again when her son was born with a rare genetic condition that requires frequent hospital visits and procedures. Constant worry and trying to be â€œtoo strong, for too longâ€ eroded her mental health and wiped her out physically.\n\nDuring one of her sonâ€™s appointments, the health visitor noticed that she was particularly stressed and encouraged her to look into NHS talking therapies. A year later Jo reached a breaking point and made the decision to seek help. Initially assuming she had general anxiety, Jo discovered through therapy that she had been living with undiagnosed PTSD for years.\n\nShe began eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy â€“ which has completely changed how she approaches life now. Guided by a skilled NHS therapist, she learned to process her unresolved traumatic memories, develop coping mechanisms, and finally understand her reactions. During her therapy, her son underwent a procedure under general anaesthetic, and for the first time, Jo felt calm and able to support him without spiralling. It was the moment she realised: â€œthis is workingâ€.\n\nJo finished therapy a year ago, and the effects have been transformative. Her sleep has improved dramatically; she no longer wakes exhausted from traumaâ€‘filled dreams and feels more present in her life. She is an avid cyclist and has achieved gold medals in Time Trial and Team Triathlon for Team GB at the World Transplant Games.\n\nJo said: â€œFollowing various health battles that affected me and my son, I tried for a long time to stay strong. I thought I was just anxious, but I was carrying years of unresolved trauma that I had never processed. I never thought that PTSD could happen to me, but it can affect anyone, as life is so unpredictable.\n\nâ€œTherapy has been unbelievable and completely changed my life. I sleep better, worry less, and I finally feel present in my life again. If you feel like you need help, you do. Put your hand up and self-refer to NHS talking therapies as early as you can. I wish I had done it sooner. Time is so preciousâ€.\n\nAnthony, 37, is a Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Manager from Carlisle, who has lived with panic disorder since he was 16.\n\nFor 20 years he carried shame, fear and confusion about his symptoms, which he says often mimicked those of a heart attack. He tried to manage it alone, worried that opening up would make him seem weak, and only shared his struggles in his early twenties.\n\nAfter the loss of his grandmother in 2024 and a particularly stressful period at work, Anthony began experiencing up to 6 panic attacks a day. Supported by his wife and colleagues, he was referred to NHS talking therapies, something he initially resisted as he wasnâ€™t keen on speaking to a stranger. But over 10-12 sessions, he slowly realised how much relief came from putting his experiences into words. Using tools such as keeping a diary and setting clear goals, he began to understand and manage the physical sensations that once overwhelmed him.\n\nAnthony said: I lived with panic attacks for 20 years, trying to manage it alone, and it impacted every part of my life. The constant worry about when the next panic attack would happen made it really difficult to focus â€“ at work, I couldnâ€™t get through emails or daily tasks, and in my personal life I couldnâ€™t concentrate long enough to read books which was always something that had brought me comfort.\n\nâ€œBut NHS talking therapies changed everything â€“ its broken a cycle I thought Id be stuck in forever. I went from having 6 panic attacks a day at its worst, to just 1 or 2 a month now â€“ I finally feel in control again and am able to concentrate for longer periods, so have even started reading again and joined a book club. If youâ€™re struggling, please donâ€™t wait as long as I did. You only get one life, so be brave enough to put yourself first and get the support you deserve.\n\nIn a new survey of 2,002 adults in England, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of the NHS, nearly half of the public said they did not know anything about social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, while two thirds did not know what body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is.\n\nThe survey found that strong misconceptions around conditions persist â€“ with over a third of the public thinking â€˜most people are a bit OCDâ€™ and nearly 3 in 10 believe PTSD mainly affects military veterans and 1 in 5 think social anxiety is â€˜the same as being shyâ€™.\n\nThe latest NHS talking therapies statistics show that the vast majority of patients referred to the service access treatment within 6 weeks, with 88.6% accessing services within 6 weeks of their referral last year.\n\nAlso speaking out about the benefits of NHS talking therapies as part of the campaign is Phillip Davis, 41 from Cheshire.\n\nPhillip said: â€œI struggled with my mental health a lot in the past. But when I was on my own after my divorce, I realised that if I didnâ€™t do something to help myself, I was going to lose my kids. I was probably going to end up in hospital, because I had tried to overdose once at that point. I thought, I canâ€™t survive like this â€“ I knew I needed help, and I didnâ€™t know what to do on my own.\n\nâ€œEvery session Iâ€™ve had with NHS talking therapies, Iâ€™ve walked out feeling at least a little bit better. They donâ€™t tell you what to do, but they help you find ways to deal with things. Sometimes itâ€™s cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sometimes itâ€™s just a change in outlook â€” like looking at something from a different angle. It helps massively.\n\nâ€œAnd after my last round of talking therapies, when I was also going through employment support, they helped build my self-confidence, and I made some big life choices not long after.\n\nHis message to others is: â€œGet the help thatâ€™s there. I know it can be hard to find, especially for blokes. But it is there, and you should take itâ€.\n\nThe NHS campaign will run for 6 weeks â€‹with adverts showing across TV-on-demand services, online video, radio, digital audio and podcasts, social media and search engines.\n\nNHS talking therapies treatment involves talking to a trained professional in a safe space about your thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and can include methods such as CBT, counselling or guided self-help, depending on the mental health condition.\n\nLatest official statistics , published by NHS England, show that people of working age (16 to 64) are more likely to have a common mental health condition than those aged 75 and over. Prevalence among those aged 16 to 64 was nearly 1 in 4 (22.6%), compared to around 1 in 10 of those aged 75 and over (10.2%).\n\nThe new campaign puts a spotlight on 6 common mental health conditions, which are often mistaken or underplayed, and can be treated by NHS talking therapies.\n\nCommon symptoms for these conditions include:\n\nfrequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours (OCD)\n\nlong-term and overwhelming fear of social situations (social anxiety disorder)\n\ninvoluntarily and vividly reliving traumatic events in the form of flashbacks or nightmares (PTSD)\n\nhaving regular and sudden panic attacks, often for no apparent reason (panic disorder)\n\nhaving an overwhelming and debilitating fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal (phobia)\n\nobsessive thoughts and worry about your appearance (body dysmorphic disorder)\n\nFormer Eastenders actress, Shona McGarty, said: â€œI wasâ€¯always a chatty child, but as I got older, everything changed. Around 15,â€¯I suddenlyâ€¯became painfully self-aware. I started overthinking, struggling to hold conversations, even though talking wasâ€¯literally partâ€¯of my job.\n\nâ€œMy social anxiety would happen when meeting new people, with colleagues or even at family gatherings. My heart would race, my hands would sweat, and sometimes I thought I might faint. I sometimes pretend to receive a phone call just to leave a social situation. People would say, â€œShonaâ€™s so shy,â€ or â€œsheâ€™s so quiet,â€ and it really hurt.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m worlds away from that level of panic now, because Iâ€™ve learned how to deal with it when it shows up. One thing that helps is imagining a little devil on my shoulder. I acknowledge it, and then I answer back: Thank you, but youâ€™re wrong. Iâ€™m in control. Iâ€™m safe. People arenâ€™t judging me; theyâ€™re listening because they want to hear me speak.\n\nâ€œBut the biggest help of all has been talking about it. Acknowledging social anxiety instead of fighting it. Youâ€™d be amazed at how many people feel the same way. A problem shared really is a problem halvedâ€.\n\nFormer professional footballer and mental health campaigner, Clarke Carlisle said: â€œFor over a decade, my PTSD caused me to withdraw not just from the world, but more importantly, from my family. My symptoms would be at their worst over Christmas Id experience flashbacks, traumatic memories and racing thoughts, and feared the lead up to December for many years.\n\nNow, looking at the photo of myself and familyâ€¯celebratingâ€¯my daughterâ€™s 18th birthday during the festive period means the world to me. This was the first winter where I didnt experience symptoms of PTSD but its alsoâ€¯a moment that simplyâ€¯wouldnâ€™tâ€¯exist if Iâ€¯hadnâ€™tâ€¯received treatment for my mental health, allowing me to talk through feelings and getting me to a place where I can spend precious moments with my family again.\n\nTOWIEâ€™s Charlie King said: â€œThe London Landmarks Half Marathon was a real turning point for me. After months of feeling incredibly low and demotivated because of crippling body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), signing up felt overwhelming, and I genuinely didnâ€™t know if Iâ€™d see it through. When my BDD was at its worst, I had become reclusive, Id hide behind a cap, and sometimes even looking at myself in the mirror when brushing my teeth would send me into a spiral. But through therapy, Iâ€™ve come to understand it, understand my thought-patterns and tools to manage it.\n\nCrossing that finish line was the first time in a long time that I felt proud of myself.â€¯ Similar toâ€¯my recovery journey, 13 miles once felt impossible, but taking it step by step showed me that I could keep pushing forward.\n\nâ€œSo, I look at this photo, and I can truly appreciate myself. None of this would have been possible without therapy, and I am really proud of taking the first step.\n\nMedia medic, Dr Nighat Arif GP said: â€œThe new NHS poll reveals a worrying â€˜blind spotâ€™ in public awareness around many common mental health conditions linked to anxiety. This could mean that people are missing out on treatment because they donâ€™t recognise symptoms, are embarrassed by them, or think they are not serious enough to get help for. If your life, work or relationships are being affected by OCD, phobias, body dysmorphic disorder, social anxiety or PTSD, remember that support is available with NHS talking therapies. Itâ€™s free, and your GP can refer you, or you can refer yourself online. Youâ€™ll speak to a trained therapist about your thoughts and feelings and learn practical skills and techniques so you can overcome your condition and help get you back to living your lifeâ€.\n\nYou can find out more and refer yourself for NHS Talking Therapies at nhs.uk/talk .\n\nDate published : 18 February, 2026 \n\nDate last updated : 19 February, 2026 \n\nTopics\n\nMental health",

Iâ€™d encourage anyone contacted to consider signing up to be part of this ground-breaking study.â€\n\nTen NHS mental health trusts are already supporting the project and anyone over 18 from those areas who has been diagnosed with a severe mental health condition can join.\n\nA total of 49,000 people with mental illnesses are being sought, with 2,000 already enrolled and NHS DigiTrials inviting further eligible patients. Another 1,000 people with dementia will also be included in the study.\n\nGlobalMindsâ€™ Chief Investigator, Professor James Walters from Cardiff University, said : â€œGlobalMinds provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover and identify the many personal and biological factors behind mental health conditions, so researchers can help clinicians and patients by enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis, and making available optimum treatments for all patients.\n\nâ€œPrecision medicine has already revolutionised the treatment of cancer and other rare diseases and we want GlobalMinds to bring the same breakthroughs to mental health. By creating the first large-scale dataset linking both genetic and detailed routine clinical information, GlobalMinds will unlock a new era of personalised mental health care, so we can help tackle the global mental health crisis.â€\n\nThe charity Rethink Mental Illness is also supporting the study and will help raise awareness of the research among people severely affected by mental illness.\n\nBrian Dow, Deputy Chief Executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: â€œThis study has real potential to deepen our understanding and open the door to a new generation of treatmentsâ€¯for mental illness.\n\nâ€œThe strength of the study lies in the partnership between researchers, the NHS and charities like ours, which means data can be powerfully fused with lived experience, with the voices of people experiencing mental illness remaining front and centre.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re delighted to be supporting the study to reach as many people living with severe mental illness as possible.\n\nGlobalMindsâ€¯hasâ€¯alsoâ€¯beenâ€¯designed toâ€¯ensureâ€¯the experience of people taking part is prioritised, with a dedicated Patientâ€¯Public Involvement and Engagement group.\n\nAkeela Mohammed, a GlobalMindsâ€™ Patient Public Involvement and Engagement Adviser and Founder of Healthy Her, a not-for-profit organisation that empowers South Asian women through wellbeing, sport, and community engagement, said :\n\nâ€œIt is vital that research initiatives like GlobalMinds are created from beginning to end with the voices and needs of vulnerable and less included communities at their heart, so that the outcomes benefit as many people as possible.\n\nâ€œThatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve enjoyed providing both my personal experience of mental health and professional insights into the barriers diverse communities face in accessing research, to this groundbreaking study and I cannot wait to see how this people-powered research will transform lives.â€\n\nThe study is supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), with funding from the Wellcome Trust and Johnson \u0026 Johnson.\n\nAnyone aged over 18, who is living with a diagnosed severe mental health condition and lives in participating areas, can sign up at: globalminds.org \n\nFor the GlobalMinds study, eligible patients are being invited to participate and no ones data is shared with researchers without their knowledge and permission.\n\nFurther information\n\nMore information about Global Minds is available here: globalminds.org \n\nGlobalMinds is open to anyone aged 18 or over with a diagnosis of Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Major Depression, or a related condition who live in an area with a participating NHS Trust. Participants sign up online via: globalminds.org and following a brief eligibility check, answer a digital questionnaire. They then are asked to provide either a blood or saliva sample. At-home testing kits or visits are available, and all participants will receive a voucher of up to Â£50 as a thank you for taking part. Participants can choose to withdraw at any point without giving a reason if they decide to later.\n\nParticipating NHS trusts so far are South West London and St Georgeâ€™s Mental Health NHS Trust; Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust; Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust; Cardiff and Vale University Health Board; Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust; Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS foundation Trust; Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust; Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust; Sussex partnership NHS Foundation Trust; Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust.\n\nFounded in 2019,â€¯Akriviaâ€¯Health is a spin-out from the University of Oxford and the NHS, built on the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system.â€¯Akriviaâ€¯works in partnership with 20 NHS secondary care mental healthcareâ€¯organisationsâ€¯so far across England and Wales, to curate the electronic medical recordsâ€¯ofâ€¯\u003e6.3 millionâ€¯patients served by those hospitals. The data curation serviceâ€¯Akriviaâ€¯provides free of charge to these NHS organisations turns unstructured clinical information, inaccessible for research use by those NHS hospitals, into structured andâ€¯clinically-informativeâ€¯data points to enable better evaluation of treatment pathways and novel research into mental health conditions.â€¯Akriviaâ€¯do their work with the help of practicingâ€¯clinical academics across the country, and with an engaged network of individuals with lived experience of mental health.â€¯Akriviaâ€¯also delivers novel and exploratory research services utilising the clinical record data to accelerate insights.\n\nThe UK-led GlobalMinds research programme also includes a cohort of 1,000 dementia patients who are being directly recruited through several routes including the NHS hospitals collaborating with GlobalMinds, care homes, or through a partnership with Cera Care a digital-first home healthcare company Â  piloting in three English locations over the next few months, with further support from the relevant NIHR Research Delivery Networks.
